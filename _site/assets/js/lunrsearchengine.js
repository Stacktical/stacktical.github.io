    "body": "2019/09/21 - The definite guide to your high-performance IPFS GatewaySo you want to store and fetch your public IPFS Assets with no compromise of speed and reliability while participating in strengthening the network? You are at the right place!I compiled the essential bits so you can get this done quickly. What’s IPFS?The Interplanetary File System is exactly what the name says, a distributed file system to replace the centralized HTTP Web that we know. This is how Stacktical’s IPFS server is used to our own platform’s needs (15s faster add operations for a lightweight JSON payload). We limited the domain that accesses our node with CORS and used an Nginx encrypted proxy to handle HTTPS connections to IPFS. Turnkey solutions like Infura’s IPFS Gateway and Pinata are great to start and to give IPFS a try but everyone should avoid Centralized Services to access Decentralized (which defeat the purpose of Decentralization and don’t provide the performance and reliability you need for your (D)app. This article will cover:  The complete setup of a Cloud instance to run our IPFS node How to make your node securely available for your (D)app Some example of adding and accessing the data in your shiny IPFS NodeIPFS Server setup: We are leveraging Google Cloud Platform so this article will cover setup on a compute instance type n1-standard-1 with Debian OS but it’s pretty much straightforward on other Cloud vendors and Linux Oses. Here we create an instance with HTTP and HTTPS allowed in the firewall section (We will have an HTTP -&gt; HTTPS redirect).  Or with the GCP SDK: gcloud compute --project=stacktical-0 instances create ipfs-node-1 --zone=us-central1-b --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --image-project=debian-cloud --boot-disk-size=10GB --boot-disk-type=pd-standard --tags=http-server,https-server Storage layer: Our Node Storage need will most likely grow in size, so it’s better to give our node a dedicated Volume for flexibility and extra persistency: Add a persistent disk to your IPFS Node instance and mount it. That’s how our node fstab entry looked like: UUID=[DISK_UUID] /mnt/disks/[MNT_DIR] ext4 discard,defaults,nofail 0 2 Where:  [DISK_UUID] is the Disk Unique Id obtained with the blkid command.  [MNT_DIR] is the directory where the ipfs volume will be mounted, /mnt/disk/ipfs-disk/ in our case. Set the Volume location for IPFS to make use of it: 1234echo 'export IPFS_PATH=/mnt/disk/ipfs-disk/ipfs' &gt;&gt;~/. bash_profilesource ~/. bash_profilesudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu $IPFS_PATH/*mkdir $IPFS_PATH/ipfsYou may change the user of the chown command to yourself of a newly created one for ipfs (here ubuntu as an example). Install IPFS: This is where the fun begins, the installation of IPFS is quite straightforward. We use ipfs-update tool to install and update IPFS easily: 1234567cd ~/wget https://dist. ipfs. io/ipfs-update/v1. 5. 2/ipfs-update_v1. 5. 2_linux-amd64. tar. gztar xvfz ipfs-update_v1. 5. 2_linux-amd64. tar. gzcd ipfs-updatesudo . /install. shipfs-update versionsipfs-update install latestRunning ipfs-update install latest will automatically install the latest release of IPFS or upgrade a previous installation like this: 12345678910$ sudo ipfs-update install v0. 4. 22fetching go-ipfs version v0. 4. 22binary downloaded, verifying. . . success! tests all passed. stashing old binaryinstalling new binary to /usr/local/bin/ipfschecking if repo migration is needed. . . Installation complete!Remember to restart your daemon before continuingNow we have to initialize IPFS Server with ipfs init --profile server (making sure IPFS_PATH is properly set) to generate the repo and its configuration file. We will have to edit that configuration file to turn the install into a proper IPFS Server. You can already check the content of that configuration file in $IPFS_PATH/ipfs/config IPFS Service setup: We can now automate the IPFS daemon management with Systemd or supervisord Create the following systemd to persist the lunch of IPFS Server across reboots: 123456789101112131415sudo bash -c 'cat &gt;/lib/systemd/system/ipfs. service &lt;&lt;EOL[Unit]Description=IPFS DaemonAfter=network. target[Service]ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ipfs daemonUser=ubuntuRestart=alwaysLimitNOFILE=10240Environment= IPFS_PATH=/mnt/disks/ipfs-disk/ipfs [Install]WantedBy=multi-user. targetEOL'We can now enable that service to start upon reboots: 123$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload$ sudo systemctl enable ipfs$ sudo systemctl start ipfsIPFS Gateway setup: Configure CORS on IPFS 12ipfs config --json API.

We can now restart the IPFS service to apply the changes: sudo systemctl restart ipfs Test: Test connectivity and CORS: 1234curl -v -H  Origin: http://&lt;wrong or right domains&gt;  \-H  Access-Control-Request-Method: POST  \-H  Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-Requested-With  \http://0. 0. 0. 0:5001/api/v0/swarm/peersYou can test the non/working reachability from different domains according to your CORS restrictions NGINX Proxy Setup: An NGINX installation as a proxy pass will enable us to store data with POST methods to https://&lt;your ipfs domain&gt;/api/v0/add and fetch them with GET method tohttps://&lt;your ipfs domain&gt;/ipfs First let’s install nginx. on Debian Based distributions: 123sudo apt updatesudo apt install -y nginxsudo systemctl status nginxInstall Certbot: By following the instructions on the Certbot site: (https://certbot. eff. org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuxenial-nginx. html)[https://certbot. eff. org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuxenial-nginx. html] This will have our nginx configuration file ready for us to add the final touches.

    "title": "DSLA.eth ENS Domain Name Acquired",
    "body": "2019/08/23 - Stacktical secures the DSLA. eth ENS domain nameToday the Stacktical team has been successfully granted the 4 characters DSLA. eth short domain name after a review conducted by the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Team conducted during the official ENS Short Name Reservation Process. Our team is glad to own ` DSLA. eth` and is looking forward to enriching the experience of the Stacktical community and the capabilities of the Stacktical Platform with cryptography-verified URLs and web proterties that everybody can trust . About the Ethereum Name Service (ENS): ENS is the domain name system that is built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain Network. As you might know, Internet is made of protocols that allow individuals to access online ressource using IP addresses,like 165. 42. 13. 37. The purpose of a domain name system is to replace such sequence of numbers with something that is easier to read, remember and use, like stacktical. com. In that spirit, the Ethereum Name Service eliminates the need to read, remember and use 42 characters long addresses, like 0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe, to access decentralized resources, send cryptocurrencies and interact with DApps. You can already expect ` DSLA. eth` to provide effortless access to our token smart contract. ENS addresses are already supported by multiple mobile and desktop cryptocurrency wallets, and some online services like popular cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. Time for a better, safer, fairer Web: ENS is not just the name service for Ethereum, it is an important piece of the Web 3. 0 infrastructure that paves the way to a better, more decentralized Internet.  ENS offers a secure &amp; decentralised way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names. Nick Johnson and the rest of the ENS Team are continuously improving the ENS service, allowing domains to be transfered easily as tokens and be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. We’re always excited for their new developements, such as the recently introduced ability to handle Tor . onion addresses. "

    "body": "2019/07/30 -  Stacktical and XYO announce their partnership to empower the future of the travel industry and reinvent travel experiences using their respective technologies. PARIS, FRANCE — Stacktical, a Blockchain Platform for managing Service Level Agreements (SLA), and XYO, the first Geospatial Blockchain Network, are joining forces to introduce Geospatial Decentralized Service Level Agreements to the travel industry and superchage the operations of airline companies, airports and more travel service providers. With over 20 million luggages lost by airlines last year, and a record number of flight delays costing nearly 30 billion dollars to travel stakeholders, the travel industry is in urgent need for new governance approaches and technology solutions to remain sustainable. By joining forces, Stacktical and XYO can align airline and airport logistics capabilities with the risk that consumers are willing to bear, and ultimately alleviate the frustration of travelers upon delays and other service failures. This partnership is also a unique opportunity for Stacktical to explore how combining an open network of service level agreements and cryptocurrency incentives can increase the efficiency of existing consumer laws, such as the European Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004, that entitles travelers to compensation following flight delays. About XYO Network (XYO): XYO is a network of devices that anonymously collect and validate geospatial data, such as the location of an e-commerce package or the humidity of the world’s most remote places.  About Stacktical (DSLA): Powered by the DSLA token, Stacktical is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) platform for documenting, bargaining and tracking service commitments between service providers, employees and customers. Decentralized SLAs align the interests of service stakeholders by creating an open network of highly automated agreements that can boost employee morale and settle customer disputes using DSLA token service credits.

    "title": "DSLA Listing (Slightly) Delayed",
    "body": "2019/07/24 - No new listing date yet, but a matter of days: Originally scheduled for July 25th, 2019, we regret to inform you that the DSLA token listing has been posponed, due to unforeseen circumstances with DSLA deposits and withdrawals on the P2PB2B exchange. We have no exact date to share at this stage, but according to official information we have received from our account manager, the DSLA token will still be listed in a matter of days. Don’t do DSLA deposits to the exchange yet: Yesterday, members in our community noticed that the DSLA deposit feature had mistakenly been made available to all users on the exchange, despite any official announcement from P2PB2B and Stacktical. Please refrain from doing any DSLA deposit until further notice, you might lose your assets. In reality, the DSLA token smart contract integration was, and is still undergoing live testing before getting approved for effective listing, and the DSLA deposit featured should have never been available to users, other than P2PB2B developers. The postponement of the DSLA listing is the result of integration issues, raised by the aforementioned live testing session. While the development team achieved a certain degree of successful integration of DSLA, they expressed the will to fix these issues before listing us, rather than potentially undermining the community’s DSLA trading experience on d-day. While we undertand your frustration, we believe that P2PB2B team’s approach to handling the issue is in the true spirit of reliability engineering, and we appreciate their commitment to maintaining a good quality of service for their exchange, even if it means exposing the Stacktical team and our community to some downtime. It’s in our DNA to approach these situations cool-headed, since Stacktical has been created to help service providers align their reliability engineering and customer service capabilities with the risk that customers are willing to bear. Turning a bad situation into an opportunity: We would like to take this unfortunate opportunity to announce that, along with listing of the DSLA token on the P2PB2B exchange, Stacktical is also proud to partner with P2PB2B to help them track their quality of service, boost employee morale and compensate customers for service level violations, in a highly automated way. We will make sure to share the ins and outs of our partnership in a dedicated post. Ultimately, this bad customer experience is a foundational step to a future where uptime, deposit, withdrawal and other exchange commitments, are backed with Stacktical’s Decentralized Service Level Agreements and the DSLA token. It does help to have a taste of your own medecine. "

    "title": "DSLA Vesting Schedule",
    "body": "2019/06/26 - Vesting Schedule: The distribution of the DSLA tokens to token sale contributors follows a specific calendar called a vesting schedule.  A token vesting process is a common process in which a number of tokens are secured and locked away by a company for a certain period of time. It helps to prevent market price manipulations and protect the stability of the token over time.   Initial allocation per token sale contributor type: Private sale contributor: This type of contributor has obtained 25% of their total purchase, at the moment of purchase. Pre sale contributor: This type of contributor has obtained 50% of their total purchase, at the moment of purchase. Public sale contributor: This type of contributor has obtained 75% of their total purchase, at the moment of purchase. Agreement for future token allocation: According to our token sale smart contract and other signed agreements, a token sale contributor is authorized to claim 25% more DSLA from her total DSLA purchase, every 3 months, since January 1st 2018. Here is the corresponding vesting table:            At Purchase    March 31st    June 30th    September 30th         Private sale contributor                   Pre sale contributor                    Public sale contributor                 How to claim (expert users): To claim your tokens, expert user can directly call the public claimTokens() function from the wallet used to contribute to the DSLA token sale. 1234567891011  /**   * @dev Allows the sender to claim the tokens he is allowed to withdraw   */  function claimTokens() public {    require(getWithdrawableAmount(msg. sender) != 0);    uint256 amount = getWithdrawableAmount(msg. sender);    withdrawn[msg. sender] = withdrawn[msg. sender]. add(amount);    _deliverTokens(msg. sender, amount);  }Please see our token sale contract repository for reference.

    "title": "Verizon Knocked Large Parts of the Internet Offline Yesterday",
    "body": "2019/06/25 - My name is route: On June 24th, Verizon accidently started routing Internet traffic through a small company in Nothern Pennsylvania for nearly three hours, causing a major outage of Cloudflare, Facebook, Amazon and other online service providers, including customers of the three aforementioned technology companies (including Discord). According to Cloudflare’s incident report, although they repeatedly called and emailed their support, the Cloudflare Ops team still had not hear from Verizon at the time of writing, over 8 hours after the incident. Nobody was aware of Verizon taking action to resolve the issue.  At Cloudflare, we wish that events like this never take place, but unfortunately the current state of the Internet does very little to prevent incidents such as this one from occurring. Fortunately, routing security technologies like RPKI and Decentralized Security SLAs powered by Stacktical could bring new ways to mitigate these risks in the future.
