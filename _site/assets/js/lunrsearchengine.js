    "body": "2019/06/26 - Vesting Schedule: The distribution of the DSLA tokens to token sale contributors follows a specific calendar called a vesting schedule.  A token vesting process is a common process in which a number of tokens are secured and locked away by a company for a certain period of time. It helps to prevent market price manipulations and protect the stability of the token over time.   Initial allocation per token sale contributor type: Private sale contributor: This type of contributor has obtained 25% of their total purchase, at the moment of purchase. Pre sale contributor: This type of contributor has obtained 50% of their total purchase, at the moment of purchase. Public sale contributor: This type of contributor has obtained 75% of their total purchase, at the moment of purchase. Agreement for future token allocation: According to our token sale smart contract and other signed agreements, a token sale contributor is authorized to claim 25% more DSLA from her total DSLA purchase, every 3 months, since January 1st 2018. Here is the corresponding vesting table:            At Purchase    March 31st    June 30th    September 30th         Private sale contributor                   Pre sale contributor                    Public sale contributor                 How to claim (expert users): To claim your tokens, expert user can directly call the public claimTokens() function from the wallet used to contribute to the DSLA token sale. 1234567891011  /**   * @dev Allows the sender to claim the tokens he is allowed to withdraw   */  function claimTokens() public {    require(getWithdrawableAmount(msg. sender) != 0);    uint256 amount = getWithdrawableAmount(msg. sender);    withdrawn[msg. sender] = withdrawn[msg. sender]. add(amount);    _deliverTokens(msg. sender, amount);  }Please see our token sale contract repository for reference.

    "body": "2019/06/25 - My name is route: On June 24th, Verizon accidently started routing Internet traffic through a small company in Nothern Pennsylvania for nearly three hours, causing a major outage of Cloudflare, Facebook, Amazon and other online service providers, including customers of the three aforementioned technology companies (including Discord). According to Cloudflare’s incident report, although they repeatedly called and emailed their support, the Cloudflare Ops team still had not hear from Verizon at the time of writing, over 8 hours after the incident. Nobody was aware of Verizon taking action to resolve the issue.  At Cloudflare, we wish that events like this never take place, but unfortunately the current state of the Internet does very little to prevent incidents such as this one from occurring. Fortunately, routing security technologies like RPKI and Decentralized Security SLAs powered by Stacktical could bring new ways to mitigate these risks in the future.

We have approached major DEX platform that we have been experimenting with for the past weeks. We’re hoping that having DSLA also listed on a DEX, along with being listed on centralized exchanges, will provide more options to the community. Finance / Ops:  In preparation for exchange listing, we plan on burning 1B DSLA tokens. This will reduce the total supply from 10B to 9B DSLA. Legal / Ops:  To improve our efficiency in dealing reaching agreements with our stakeholders, the Legal Team has started refactoring the different steps of our legal lifecycle. Our Legal Manager will introduce a series of flow charts describing improved operations.  We have initiated a series of workshop to ensure the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance of the upcoming DSLA Network. "

Between the mathematical models that we use to predict the scalability of systems, our ongoing efforts in decentralizing service level agreements and our daily operations, there are endless opportunities to share insights with our ever growing community. So far, our Medium publications have proved useful in doing exactly that, often through rendez-vous like our weekly status updates. But in order to ensure your ability to consume Stacktical content without restrictions in the long run, we’ve decided to embrace a more open alternative as our main communication channel. Moving forward, the Stacktical Blog at blog. stacktical. com will your premier destination for product, market and corporate news about Stacktical and the DSLA token. We are ready to double down on blogging while venturing into new, multimedia grounds. Thank you for visiting! "
