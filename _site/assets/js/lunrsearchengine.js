About DSLA Protocol: DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables developers and infrastructure operators to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools. Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).

    "title": "Introducing DSLA Protocol v1.0 and the future of third-party risk management",
    "body": "2021/03/25 - The Downside of Convenience: Whether as individuals or as organisations, we delegate increasingly more functions of our lives to third-party service providers. But with increased convenience, comes increased exposure to risk. And most users lack the expertise, capital and time to manage it. So we created DSLA Protocol. It enables the different stakeholders of a given service to trade third-party risk with each other, using Decentralized Service Level Agreements (SLA). Decentralized SLAs are peer-to-peer outsourcing contracts, running on a blockchain network. They can store and release cryptocurrency, based on the performance analytics of third-party services. Instead of simply providing coverage like insurance products, Decentralized SLAs bring an extra layer of trust to the user-provider relationship, by guaranteeing consistent returns for users, and by incentivising providers for speed, power, uptime and more. DSLA Protocol: Today, we are excited to tell you more about how DSLA Protocol is going to put your third-party risk management on autopilot. We are targeting an L1 Ethereum mainnet launch on March 31, 2021, with L2, Harmony and Avalanche deployments to follow shortly after. All deployments are contingent on the results of ongoing security audits. DSLA Protocol v1 introduces a series of in-house innovations:    Risk Prediction Markets, enabling developers, users, and liquidity providers to trade risk with each other using Decentralized Service Level Agreements (SLA);     Reliability Forecasts, enabling third-party risk assessment at a glance, through the wisdom of the SLA marketplace and its participants;     SLA Futures Positions, tokenised LONG/SHORT positions issued to the SLA creator taking on risk (LONG), or to SLA users offsetting risk (SHORT);     A Triple Token Design, to separate the functions of SLA enforcement, and tokenisation of LONG/SHORT SLA positions;     SLA Staking Rewards, to incentivise the creation of decentralized service level agreements, and the availability of subsequent reliability forecasts;     Native Token Burns, everytime a SLA is verified, to ensure the long-term sustainability of DSLA Protocol and utility of DSLA Token;     Programmable SLAs, enabling the addition of new types of SLAs and use cases over time, developed by the community;     Developer Tools, enabling developers to add risk management capabilities to their service, or design risk-aware customer experiences from scratch;     No Code Tools, enabling third-party service providers to add risk management widgets to their service, without technical knowledge.  These innovations make DSLA Protocol the 1st ever Risk Prediction Market Maker. Although we generally identify ourselves as a Risk Management framework. Risk Prediction Markets: Prediction Markets let you trade the outcome of real world events. In DSLA Protocol, service stakeholders can trade third-party risk with each other, by staking on the outcome of periodic events, called SLA verifications. A stakeholder is a user, a provider or someone willing to stake on either side of the user-provider relationship. If a SLA verification establishes that the terms of a SLA have been honoured by the third-party service provider, the contract creator earns a cryptocurrency reward. And if the SLA is breached, the contract stakeholders can claim the cryptocurrency reward for themselves. DSLA Protocol is permissionless, so the contract creator does not need to be affiliated to the provider to create a SLA. Instead, anybody can stake on either side of the user-provider relationship to take on risk or offset risk, then earn SLA staking rewards based on the outcome of SLA verifications. SLA Contract Types: DSLA Protocol is specialized in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) Risk Reduction, with an initial focus on mitigating staking efficiency drops. Staking Efficiency is the percentage of rewards collected by a staking service provider, compared to the rewards he would have collected in ideal conditions. It gives users a sense of how much returns they are missing out on, compared to the initial returns promised by their staking service provider. This use case has been developed by Stacktical, the core development team of DSLA Protocol. But it only scratches the surface of its capabilities, as the protocol can evolve through the addition of other types of SLA, and support new use cases in a wide range of industries. In fact, we went as far as rewarding SLA contract type developers, every time a risk prediction market uses their code during a SLA verification. Reliability Forecasts: As the SLA marketplace gets populated, and tokenized SLA positions get issued, the sentiment surrounding a third-party service will become quantifiable. Beyond user reviews, DSLA Protocol is the 1st risk management framework to rely on the wisdom of the crowd to establish service delivery goals, and facilitate third-party risk assessment. Tokenized SLA Positions: To either offset or take on risk, users and liquidity providers need to stake cryptocurrency to a SLA. Upon staking, stakeholders are issued a new, liquid token representing their SLA position. The tradable nature of these tokens will surely come in handy later. Triple Token Model: Along with the DSLA utility token, that is already issued, DSLA Protocol dynamically issues and relies on two other tokens to empower its SLA use cases. DSLA Protocol’s Triple Token Model is comprised of:  DSLA, our utility token empowering periodic SLA verifications and governance, DSLA-SP, a token representing a SHORT, user position for offsetting risk DSLA-LP, a token representing a LONG, provider position for taking on riskSLA Staking Rewards: Although they are supposed to drive customer satisfaction, traditional service level agreements are disconnected from the economic remediation of breaches. They also create an incentive for providers to deliver minimum service at minimum cost. Decentralized SLAs, on the contrary, have the ability to grant cryptocurrency to both Users and Providers, based on how much a service deviates from the Service Level Objectives (SLO) defined in the SLA. Both sides of the user-provider relationship can be bet on. The more the service exceeds expectations, the more rewards are granted to the SLA contract creator. Users, on the other end, are free to overcollateralize their third-party risk, to earn bigger compensations. SLA Verification Token Burn: To align the DSLA token supply with the usage of the DSLA Protocol, DSLA token are burned like fuel, everytime a SLA contract is verified. Starting from our mainnet launch, the 7B supply of DSLA tokens will decrease over time, as service stakeholders trade third-party risk on the marketplace. Developer Tools: DSLA Protocol’s ambition is to empower communities of developers and infrastructure operators to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses. Along with the ability to develop custom SLA contract types, developers can integrate DSLA Protocol into their own services, to take their user experience to higher quality standards, or develop new use cases from scratch. No Code Tools: An increasing number of non-technical stakeholders, such as organizations legal and compliance departments, are expressing strong interest in using DSLA Protocol for its business workflow automation capabilities. DSLA. network, our flagship Ðapp, will enable users without technical knowledge to export and embed parts of the DSLA experience where they see fit. e. g. In the clause of a business agreement. Tokenomics: DSLA Protocol introduces a new way to tokenize third-party risk. In order to understand its economic incentives, it is necessary to understand the motivations of its stakeholders. **There are two main types of stakeholders in DSLA Protocol: **Providers and Users. Providers create and provide liquidity to Decentralized SLA contracts, to trade the outcome of periodic SLA verifications with a bullish bias (LONG). This unit of time is the DSLA period. When they create a Decentralized SLA, Providers decide how many DSLA periods will the contract last, the goal of the contract (SLO, or Service Level Objective), and how frequent should the reliability of the service be calculated and verified (SLI, or Service Level Indicator). Providers stake DSLA tokens to pay for periodic verifications. After a DSLA Period is finished, it can be verified. The verification fee is split between:  The User doing the verification (24. 7%), to:     cover the cost of calling this function in the protocol;   incentivize a fast verification after the period is finished.     The Developer that created the verification logic (25%), to:     cover development and infrastructure costs;   incentivize the creation of new SLA contract types.     Core developers (50%), to cover infrastructure costs. The rest of DSLA tokens is burned (0. 3%). Users provide liquidity to existing Decentralized SLA contracts, to trade the outcome of periodic SLA verifications with a bearish bias (SHORT). If after comparing the SLI with the SLO, the terms of the SLA have been honoured by the third-party service provider, the Provider earns a cryptocurrency reward. And if the SLA is breached, Users can claim compensations. Now let’s have a look at how rewards and compensations are calculated. Provider Staking Rewards: The provider reward equals the Users pool, multiplied by the DSLA period reward rate. For example, if:  A SLA has 12 DSLA periods The DSLA period to verify is the 3rd The SLI deviation is 4%Users Compensations: The Users pool is completely protected by the Provider pool. This means that if the Users pool is 2000 DSLA tokens, then after a DSLA period is deemed as Not Respected, the Users pool will be 4000 DSLA tokens. After a SLA is created, staking is either open to anyone, or open to whitelisted users. In order to ensure that the rewards and compensations are correctly distributed no matter the circumstances, the staking process should comply with the following rules:    There are going to be 2 pools in place, the Users pool and Provider pool;     The Users pool should never be bigger than the Providers pool;     The Providers pool should never be smaller than the Users pool, except after the contract is finished (when the contract is breached or the last period is respected);     The users can stake at any period, if the SLA is not terminated;     The provider can stake at any period, if the SLA is not terminated;     The users can only withdraw stake after the contract is terminated;     The provider can withdraw stake at any time, as long as his pool is greater than or equal to the users pool;     Only the SLA creator can stake on the provider pool;     Everyone can stake on the users pool, except for whitelisted SLAs.  DSLA-SP &amp; DSLA-LP Tokens: After every DSLA period both pools are going to increase or decrease in size. In order to keep track of the stakeholders stakes and claiming right without taking care of DSLA periods, tokenised LONG/SHORT positions are issued to the SLA creator taking on risk (going LONG with DSLA-¨LP), or to SLA users offsetting risk (going SHORT with DSLA-SP). DSLA-LP and DSLA-SP tokens are minted/burned after every stake/withdrawal. Both the lpTokens and the spTokens are minted using functions that track their value over time. As minting is going to be applied only on not finished contracts, then we can assume that the spTokens value is going to decrease over time, because after every respected period there’s going to be a reward for the provider from the users pool, which will decrease the userStakedTokens/spTokens ratio. Using the same logic, we can say that lpTokens value is going to increase over time because of the rewards after a respected period, which will increase the providerStakedTokens/lpTokens ratio. The burning process in both cases is tied to the staking rules. The withdraw result is then proportional to the DSLA-LP and DSLA-SP that the caller is going to burn in order to withdraw her tokens. lpToken minting: The mint process is intended to maintain the providerPoolSize/lpTokenTotalSupply ratio: And the formula for minted lpTokens is: Where the lpToken minting rate is: This minting rate is going to be fixed for the current period, no matter if the provider stakes more tokens or if he withdraws. For instance, if at a given period the provider DSLA pool is 100, the lpToken total supply is 98, then the minting rate is: If the provider stakes 100 DSLA, then he is going to get: The minting rate changes only after a period is verified because the provider pool size is going to change, but the lpToken total supply is going to stand still. Imagine there is a reward of 50 DSLA after a respected period, the new lpToken minting rate would be: Which means that if the provider stakes 100 DSLA again, the lpTokens minted would be: This minted token will keep the $lpMintingRate_1$: The lpToken is then a deflationary token i. e. after every period, the average value of staked per lpTokens token is going to increase. lpToken burning: The caller is going to receive a proportion of the provider pool, represented by how much lpTokens is willing to burn, but keeping the user providerPoolSize/lpTokens ratio: The burned lpTokens and caller withdraw formulas are: From here, we can state two formulas:    $lpBurnRate$: how many lpTokens the caller is going to burn for every withdrawn staked token       $dpWithdrawRate$: how many staked tokens the caller is going to receive for every burned spToken  spToken minting: The mint process is intended to maintain the usersPoolSize/spTokenTotalSupply ratio: And the formula for minted lpTokens is: Where the spToken minting rate is: For instance, if the user pool size is 100, the spToken total supply is 200: Which means that if a user stakes 100 DSLA on the period 2, then the spTokens minted are: Not that even after the stake, the $spMintingRate$ stays the same: spToken burning: The caller is going to receive a proportion of the users pool, represented by how much spTokens is willing to burn, but keeping the user usersPoolSize/spTokens ratio: The burned spTokens and caller withdraw formulas are: From here, we can state two formulas:  $spBurnRate$: how many spTokens the caller is going to burn by every withdrawn staked token $duWithdrawRate$: how many staked tokens the caller is going to receive by every burned spTokenThe spToken is then an inflationary token. i. e. After every period, the average value of staked token per spToken is going to decrease. Security Audits &amp; Bug Bounty: Although it is not the type of risk address by DSLA Protocol, security is close to the project’s DevOps DNA. In order to properly secure our mainnet launch, our team has sought the assistance of leading security firms and experts in the industry, and will maintain its efforts after launch. Our security process for DSLA Protocol includes:  An audit from leading smart contract auditor CertiK An audit from leading german security firm Chainsulting A security bug bounty campaign live on Immunefi Two independant audits from white hat hackers Comprehensive internal, manual and automated testingAlthough we were able to address all the bugs we encountered during internal and external auditing so far, we cannot guarantee all DSLA Protocol bugs in existence have been discovered. It is an unavoidable reality of any software development effort. In order to launch DSLA Protocol on March 31, 2021, we will need at least two successful audits from our partners. One clear, one more to go. About DSLA Protocol: DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables developers and infrastructure operators to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

Read more… Dear community, in an effort to bring our nascent developer community access to more technology ecosystems, and to empower more users and developers to tap into the risk management capabilities of DSLA Protocol, we are proud to announce that we have partnered with the Harmony core team to port DSLA Protocol to the Harmony blockchain network, and augment the experience of your cryptocurrency saving accounts (staking), decentralized financial products (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFT)! 🎉 Harmony is the 1st network we ever decided to integrate to DSLA Protocol, and one of the key driving forces of the DSLA incentivised beta that took place last November. With this official partnership, the DSLA core development team is excited to expand on our past collaboration with a wide range of novel opportunities for all Harmony stakeholders. Staking Agreements: Our immediate collaboration with the Harmony core team will focus on adding support for $ONE Staking Agreements to the DSLA. network flagship application. $ONE Staking Agreements will compensate $ONE delegators for drops in $ONE staking rewards, while rewarding $ONE validators for their ability to endorse and validate Harmony blocks over time.  Anyone can use a $ONE Staking Agreement to either give or take risk, as easily as swapping tokens on your favourite exchange. DeFi Harmony Developers: Soon after, DSLA Protocol will be deployed as smart contracts on the Harmony network, enabling Harmony network participants to trade risk with each other in virtually infinite scenarios, across the full Harmony ecosystem. We will work together with the Harmony core team on mapping the various risk consumers, companies and institutions are exposed to while using staking, DeFi and NFT products built on Harmony.  The Harmony-native edition of DSLA Protocol will then enable builders to add risk reduction capabilities to their user experience within minutes, and directly benefit from the adoption boost generated by DSLA hedges and liquidity pools. DSLA expansion to HRC20: Effective immediately, HRC20 becomes the second official token standard of the DSLA token. DSLA was successfully added to the Horizon bridge by Harmony, earlier this week.  This integration will facilitate the use of DSLA tokens in the Harmony-native edition of DSLA Protocol, as well as provide cheaper trading alternatives to our community. About Harmony: Harmony is the future of cross-chain finance, where assets can free-flow between chains and settle wherever the user decides. At the protocol level, Harmony is a fully evm-compatible sharding protocol with a trustless bi-directional Harmony to Ethereum bridge, and is purpose-built to help scale Ethereum applications that struggle with high gas costs, slow finality, and overall poor scalability.

    "body": "2021/02/21 - Use DSLA to hedge against AMM / DEX market risks: Dear DSLA champions and cryptocurrency community, following our unveil of NFT Impermanent loss Agreements, the DSLA core development team is proud to announce that we will be adding AMM Impermanent Loss Agreements to the list of service level agreements available in DSLA Protocol! 🎉 This new type of agreement will enable Pangolin, PancakeSwap and Uniswap liquidity providers to offset their Impermanent Loss, while mining rewards to anyone pooling funds in an agreement. Uniswap recently crossing $1B in daily volume, and with increasingly more decentralized exchanges providing a competitive, reliable alternative to centralized cryptocurrency exchanges. It goes without saying that Automated Market Marker (AMM) protocols has empowered both core development teams seeking a home for their asset, and cryptocurrency holders around the world, with an unprecedented level of access to the market. But without a risk management vehicle to reduce Liquidity Providers exposure to AMM market risks, AMM services will increasingly struggle to convince Liquidity Providers to pool cryptocurrency instead of simpling holding assets in their wallet, using staking and delegation savings accounts, or through other DeFi means to generate yield. The DSLA core development team is very excited by the upcoming release, and we cannot wait to share more about our Uniswap, PancakeSwap and Pangolin integrations and overall AMM strategy. AMM and Risk: What is Impermanent Loss?: Assuming you add liquidity to a 50/50 AMM pool, Impermanent Loss happens when the value of your LP tokens, ends up being less than simply holding the underlying assets of your pool. In short, AMM Impermanent Loss is a byproduct of the volatility of your pool’s assets. DSLA Protocol fixes this: By signing a DSLA contract, Liquidity Providers agree on sanctioning Impermanent Loss, and on rewarding stability and growth, for a set period of time. To activate an agreement, both parties need to put money when their mouth is, by staking DSLA, USDC or DAI to the DSLA contract liquidity pool. When a AMM Impermanent Loss Agreement is active, DSLA Protocol monitors the price AMM pool underlying assets (e. g. the price of AVAX, and the price of DSLA, for a AVAX/DSLA pool on Pangolin). If the calculated Impermanent Loss stays within the thresholds of the agreement, DSLA Liquidity Providers earn the right to claim a reward, by depleting the coverage stake of AMM Liquidity Providers. Conversely, whenever an agreement is violated, AMM Liquidity Providers earn the right to claim a compensation, by depleting the upfront commitment of DSLA Liquidity Providers.

    "body": "2021/02/18 - Use DSLA to hedge against Uniswap Rug Pulls: Dear DSLA champions and cryptocurrency community, the DSLA core development team is proud to announce that we will be adding AMM Pool Ownership Agreements to DSLA Protocol’s list available DSLA contract types! 🎉 Pool Ownership Agreements are a new type of DSLA contracts that enables core development teams to build trust with their community by provably enforcing timely liquidity ownership requirements for their Uniswap pool, and being held accountable when they don’t meet these requirements. Until now, core development teams were resorting to liquidity lock mechanisms to achieve a similar goal of being perceived as worthy of their community’s trust. But at a time where Ethereum’s dominance as the most attractive EVM-compatible blockchain network is being challenged, we strongly believe that locking your Uniswap liquidity would be a strategic mistake. With this addition, DSLA Protocol is poised to become a better way for core development teams to reduce their holders exposure to rug pulls without limiting their migration options and agility on the super hot cryptocurrency market. DEX and Risk: What are Rug Pulls?: A rug pull is an infamously common type of Uniswap scam that consists in:  1/ Issuing a ERC20 token, create its pool on Uniswap, and add liquidity to it 2/ Inflating the token price by any means necessary (e. g. Insane APYs) 3/ Brutally remove the majority of the pool’s liquidity after the token price has peakedWhen liquidity is removed after an explosive rally of the token, the scammer’s share of the Uniswap liquidity pool is worth much more ETH than it was before. DSLA Protocol fixes this: By signing a DSLA contract, a core development team and their asset holders agree on sanctioning unhealthy liquidity management practices, and on rewarding good practices, for a set period of time. To activate an agreement, both parties need to put money when their mouth is, by staking DSLA, USDC or DAI to the DSLA contract liquidity pool. When a AMM Pool Ownership Agreement is active, DSLA Protocol monitors the core development team’s share of the Uniswap pool. If their share stays within the thresholds of the agreement, core development teams earn the right to claim a reward, by depleting the coverage stake of asset holders. Conversely, whenever an agreement is violated, asset holders earn the right to claim a compensation, by depleting the upfront commitment of the team.

    "body": "2021/02/16 - Use DSLA to hedge against NFT market risks: Dear DSLA champions and cryptocurrency community, the DSLA core development team is proud to announce that we are adding support for Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs), to DSLA Protocol! 🎉 This important step of DSLA Protocol’s development will empower OpenSea and other Creators around the world to incentivise the purchase of their NTFs, and top-up their royalties using NFT Impermanent Loss Agreements. Our strong belief is that NFTs are the future of media ownership, as well as one of the greatest ways to showcase, trade and distribute creative works ever invented. But without a risk management vehicle to reduce customers exposure to market risks, NFTs will struggle to fulfill their mission as one of the defining asset classes of our generation. The DSLA core development team is very excited by the upcoming release, and we cannot wait to share more about our OpenSea integration and NFT strategy, in the near future. Introduction to Non Fungible Tokens (NFT): A non-fungible token or NFT, is a special type of cryptocurrency that represents an asset that cannot be replicated. Although Creators can create any amount of NFT copies, each copy will remain unique, indivisible and rare. This makes NFT an excellent fit for digital art, and collectibles in general. NFT and Risk: What is Impermanent Loss?: Assuming you purchase NFT digital art and collectibles using ETH, NFT Impermanent Loss happens when the value of your NFT purchased in ETH, ends up being less than simply holding ETH. In short, NFT Impermanent Loss is a byproduct of the volatility of ETH as a payment method. DSLA Protocol fixes this: By signing a DSLA contract, Creators and their customers agree on sanctioning price volatility, and on rewarding stability and growth, for a set period of time. To activate an agreement, both parties need to put money when their mouth is, by staking DSLA, USDC or DAI to the DSLA contract liquidity pool. When a NFT Impermanent Loss Agreement is active, DSLA Protocol monitors the NFT price, and the price of its underlying asset (e. g. ETH). If the calculated Impermanent Loss stays within the thresholds of the agreement, Creators earn the right to claim a reward, by depleting the coverage stake of customers. Conversely, whenever an agreement is violated, customers earn the right to claim a compensation, by depleting the upfront commitment of Creators. Join the conversation on Telegram! About DSLA Protocol: DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements and bonus-malus insurance policies. Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).

    "title": "Announcing DSLA Maxima "Avalanche Edition"",
    "body": "2021/02/04 - DSLA Protocol for Avalanche: DSLA Protocol enables anyone to add a service level agreement on top of any third-party service, to reduce customers exposure to infrastructure risks and incentivise the connectivity, performance and availability of services, networks and applications over time. To bring our developer community access to more technologies, we are proud to announce that we are joining forces with Ava Labs, to launch DSLA Maxima “Avalanche Edition”, a maximalist port of DSLA Protocol on the Avalanche blockchain network. Staking SLAs…: Our immediate collaboration will focus on adding support for $AVAX Staking Agreements to the DSLA. network flagship application. Successfully validating or delegating on Avalanche requires that certain parameters are met—a validator must be correct and online for 60% of the time to receive rewards, for example. If parameters like uptime percentages aren’t met, rewards are not distributed. Unlike existing blockchain platforms, Avalanche does not slash your stake. When delegating on Avalanche, you’re relying on existing validators to stake your AVAX on your behalf (hence why users are subject to additional fees set by validators). Therefore for delegators, meeting these parameters are in the hands of third-party service providers. DSLA provides a better way to manage exposure to third-party infrastructure risk.  When the monitored performance of a service (in this case, the ability for delegators to meet the Avalanche staking parameters) stays within the thresholds of an agreement, DSLA contract liquidity providers earn the right to claim a bonus from the agreement’s liquidity pool. Conversely, when an agreement is violated because of the bad performance of a service, DSLA contract policyholders earn the right to claim compensation. Soon after, DSLA Protocol will be deployed as smart contracts on the Avalanche network, serving the same purpose, but with built-in interoperability and scalability that are unique to Avalanche, hence the “Maxima” codename. …And more: In the long term, the DSLA core development team will enable developers to add high-throughput, risk management and parametric insurance capabilities to their application built on Avalanche. “As the Ethereum blockchain network increasingly struggles to satisfy the engineering requirements of developers, and is failing to bank the unbanked because of unsustainable fees, our team is convinced that an EVM-compatible blockchain like Avalanche has the potential to become a new, more scalable home for DeFi and the next generation of Solidity-based decentralized applications. ” said Wilhem Pujar, CEO at Stacktical and DSLA Protocol core developer. About Avalanche: Avalanche is an open-source platform for launching decentralized applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Avalanche is the first smart contracts platform that processes 4,500+ transactions/second and instantly confirms transactions. Ethereum developers can quickly build on Avalanche as Solidity works out-of-the-box.

We are proud to announce that we are collaborating with Nomadic Labs, Tezos core developers, to add $XTZ Baking Agreements to the DSLA. network flagship application. If you do not want to operate your own Tezos node to earn baking rewards, you can outsource this task to a third-party baking and validation service. But while delegating your XTZ tokens is easier than validating Tezos blocks yourself, it exposes you to the potential bad behaviour, as well as the connectivity, performance and availability failures of your baker. This might lead you to miss out baking rewards because of downtimes, and losing a fraction of your baking deposit because of slashing penalties. That’s where DSLA and $XTZ Baking Agreements come in.  Upon its mainnet launch in Q1 this year, DSLA Protocol will enable anyone to effortlessly hedge against baking risks, and passively earn rewards for protecting baking deposits. Tezos has been at the forefront of the staking movement that has radically transformed the blockchain and cryptocurrency industries in the past two years, and a major source of inspiration for the Stacktical team. It is also one of the few blockchain networks to attract large corporate partners such as the Société Générale bank (145K employees, €25B+ revenue) and Électricité de France EDF (150K employees, €68B+ revenue), France’s national energy provider. Our team is excited to improve the baking experience of the Tezos community, and further drive baking adoption among SLA-savvy, Fortune 500 level corporations, thanks to DSLA Protocol and the DSLA family of products.

    "title": "DSLA Protocol to support ERC20 Stablecoins at launch, Selected Utility Tokens later",
    "body": "2021/01/18 - DSLA Protocol Staking: While a lot of the conversation has been focusing the compensation capabilities of DSLA Protocol, DSLA Staking is one of the most important pilars of the DSLA experience, and a key utility of the DSLA token. To give service customers access to a rich, open marketplace of peer-to-peer service level agreements, we designed DSLA Staking Rewards as crypto-economic incentives that stimulate the creation of agreements, and justify adding liquidity to existing agreement pools to further empower possible compensation claims. A two-step, “create and stake” process we call Vouching. Vouchers are liquidity providers that are vouching for the connectivity, performance or availability of a service they do not necessarily operate themselves. In exchange for expanding the list of available hedges on the DSLA contract marketplace, and for supporting third-party service providers in their service delivery efforts, DSLA Protocol rewards Vouching Positions, by depleting the insurance premium deposited by service customer every time a DSLA contract is honoured. This enables DSLA Protocol to ensure better compliance of its operations and create value for liquidity providers beyond generating groundless yields, or capturing protocol fees. ERC20 Stablecoins: Along with DSLA token staking, DSLA Protocol will also support DAI and USDC stablecoins staking to DSLA contracts, at mainnet launch. This addition will reinforce the protocol’s ability to de-risk the full extent of the value at risk in delegated proof-of-stake networks, from day one. A value, ~$35M per our estimates, that currently exceeds the fully diluted market capitalization of the DSLA utility token ($8M at the time of writing). DAI and USDC will be added to the DSLA contract creation workflow, and will provide a simple option to reduce proof-of-stake delegators exposure to the volatility of the DSLA token in DSLA compensation scenarios. Vouchers will have the ability to remain exposed to DSLA in DSLA reward scenarios, as they monitor the early evolution of the DSLA utilituy token market capitalization. Other ERC20 Tokens: So far, we have shared that anyone can stake DSLA tokens and stablecoins to DSLA contract pools, to empower volatile and stable DSLA reward / compensation scenarios in DSLA Protocol. But about about other tokens in the ERC20 standard? We are proud to announce that we are also working with selected partners to add support for their own ERC20 utility token assets to DSLA Protocol, as part of our white labeling and branding effort catering to proof-of-stake network core development teams, and their community of staking pool operators. Although PayPal and its financial technology legacy enabled third-party service providers to somehow rejuvenate their brand by accepting new currency options in their payment flow, until now, true currencies were largely left out of companies Marketing Mix. Just like it makes sense for the Elrond Edition of DSLA Protocol to use $eGLD as a native currency, it makes sense for a provider to distribute its own currency to its stakeholders, through the different functional scenarios of the DSLA Protocol. With cryptocurrency, DSLA Buy Backs: Road to DAO: In its first year of operation, 50% of all fees captured while using different cryptocurrencies in DSLA contract liquidity pools on the Ethereum mainnet, will be swapped back to DSLA ERC20 utility tokens, and added to the DSLA Protocol’s treasury. The buybacks will be transparently documented in a monthly report, and the funds auditable by our community. The DSLA Protocol Treasury will serve as a foundation for our upcoming governance efforts, an important topic we will make sure to articulate in a dedicated post soon. Conclusion: Our vision for the future is that every company in the world will be represented by its own cryptocurrency asset. It’s only natural to make sure that DSLA Protocol can support these assets, to pave the way to customer experience automation practices that are on par with existing branding and loyalty efforts of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS companies. About DSLA Protocol: As users outsource increasingly more functions of their lives and businesses to third-party service providers, they need better ways to manage their exposure to third-party infrastructure risk. Especially when money is at stake. DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that gives anyone the ability to create, monitor and execute decentralized service level agreements and parametric insurance policies. When the monitored performance of a service is within the thresholds of an agreement, third-party service providers and liquidity providers earn the right to claim a reward from the agreement liquidity pool. Conversely, when an agreement is violated, customers earn the right to claim a compensation. Win-Win.

May your aspirations come true, and let us all make a conscious effort to approach the days, weeks and months ahead with renewed resilience and confidence. While the rest of the world seems to be on the verge of collapsing, the cryptocurrency industry is glimmering with optimism. Proof-of-Stake is taking over Layer 1 blockchain networks, Layer 2 blockchain sub-networks start addressing barriers to enterprise adoption, and there is a rapidly growing number of decentralized applications and protocols that our global community can tap into for education, for inspiration, for utility. Our team now also possesses all the components it needs to share our full vision for DSLA Protocol, and articulate a more cohesive product offering than ever before. DSLA Protocol: DSLA is a protocol for developers, designed to streamline the integration of site reliability engineering and parametric insurance to the next wave of connected and online customer experiences. Once DSLA Protocol’s smart contracts and official documentation will be available, any developer will be able to tap into the protocol’s functions to implement the use case of their choice, and augment the user experience of their existing products. As developers ourselves, we use DSLA Protocol to build DSLA. network, our flagship Ðapp. It provides a financial hedge against staking infrastructure risks for Proof-of-Stake delegators, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators. Think of it as a way to lead developers by example, with a laser-focused use case with high commercial viability. To ensure that DSLA. network meets its market, we ran hundreds of user interviews with wallet developers, staking pool operators and Proof-of-Stake network teams, and addressed their functional and non-functional requirements with care. Except for one requirement: the ability to use DSLA Protocol on other blockchain networks than Ethereum. Agnos &amp; Maxima: To address the need expressed by an ever growing number of potential customers and friends, we are officializing DSLA Maxima, a native, stand-alone edition of DSLA Protocol on your favorite network. Our network-agnostic product, the original DSLA Protocol running on the Ethereum blockchain, will be identified as DSLA Agnos, moving forwards. With Maxima, the DSLA core developers are joining forces with the best Proof-of-Stake network teams to enable our community of developers to :  Tap into their network-specific capabilities (e. g. Elrond’s high throughput); Access available DeFi protocols using composability; Use their favorite cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency standard;Furthermore, Maxima will empower the development of new industry use cases that are either not possible on Ethereum today, or a poor fit for a variety of reasons.

    "title": "Beta Outro Part 2: Conclusion",
    "body": "2020/12/04 - Update your Bookmarks: This is the 2nd post of a two-part Beta Outro series, signaling the end of the DSLA Incentivized Beta. Read the 1st post here. Dear DSLA champions, now that the DSLA incentivized beta has ended, the beta DSLA. network Ðapp, running on the Ropsten test network and powered by Band Protocol, has permanently moved to beta. dsla. network. We do not plan on maintaining it much, it is more akin to a live archive. The main address at DSLA. network now gives you access to the latest version of the MVP Ðapp, running on the Kovan test network and powered by Chainlink. Please use it as a reference from now on. The MVP Ðapp is the closest thing there is to the upcoming mainnet release, except for the use of test assets. The DSLA core development team will keep updating the MVP, until it reaches the functional and non-functional requirements set for the mainnet. The Missing Parts of beta. dsla. network: During the beta, we did not manage to ship bDSLA withdrawal and claiming features within the allocated time. A series of reliability incidents highlighted point of failures in the beta architecture, and hindered our ability to develop in realtime, hackathon conditions. We also identified risks of conflicts and overlaps between the two missing features, as the protocol’s time-based rules were not mature enough at the time to account for certain edge cases and race conditions. bDSLA withdrawals: Since withdrawals are contigent on these rules, and considering our shift to a stake-and-forget model, where you only need to stake once for all the available periods of a given DSLA contract, withdrawals are being redeveloped from the ground up. They will never make it to beta. dsla. network. bDSLA claims: With the recent architectural change of DSLA Protocol, the implementation of the claiming feature has significantly diverged from the target mainnet implementation. DSLA Protocol relies on an oracle network to perform 3 types of operations:    ① Display accurate, realtime price information in DSLA contracts so users can monitor their liquidity pools, hedges and policy valuations;     ② Convert users stakes and delegations into their DSLA and stablecoin equivalent to make liquidity and insurance deposits;     ③ Connect DSLA contracts with decentralized indexers during a contract verification to trigger claims and insurance payouts.  During the beta, our oracle developments were spread across the Ðapp, an API and our protocol’s smart contracts, for each one of these operations. Too much overhead that we could handle, in hindsight. Meet you at the Bonfire: While the DSLA architecture has dramatically improved, and that key areas of the DSLA Protocol and the DSLA. network Ðapp have been battle-tested, it is unfortunate that the community did not get a proper end-to-end taste of the DSLA experience before launch. But instead of allocating more resources to the beta Ðapp, and running into more third-party infrastructure issues, we will focus our team’s efforts on our core mission. All claims based on your staking activity during the beta will be directly available on the mainnet’s revamped bonfire upon launch. For a Better, Safer Mainnet in Q1 2021: The tentative launch window of the DSLA Protocol and the DSLA. network Ðapp on the mainnet was contingent on the pace of developments, and mandatory security audits. As expressed in our previous post, we do not quite meet the mainnet functional requirements just yet. From a security standpoint, the current backlog of our auditing partners does not allow a Q4 2020 launch. There are a lot of projects waiting to be audited at the moment, and the waiting time increases with the limited capacity of auditing teams during the Holiday season. We have decided to set the new launch window of the DSLA Protocol and the DSLA. network Ðapp to Q1 2021 to remove all incentives to rush security audits, to further polish our developments based on the incentivized beta test feedbacks, and to have more room to introduce the community to our growing list of mainnet partners through a series of marketing initiatives. Stay tuned for our upcoming partnership announcements, 10 AMAs with the best AMAs communities in the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry, a new wave of influencer coverage of DSLA Protocol, and multiple other exciting events, as we get closer to primetime. Join the conversation on Telegram. About DSLA Protocol: DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

    "title": "Stacktical integrates Chainlink to bring battle-tested Oracles to the DSLA Protocol Mainnet",
    "body": "2020/12/01 - DSLA x Chainlink: Dear community, Stacktical, the core development team of the DSLA Protocol, is proud to announce that we have integrated Chainlink to bring its widely used decentralized Price Feeds and staking analytics data to the DSLA Protocol mainnet and its flagship Ðapp, DSLA. network. DSLA Protocol provides a financial hedge against staking infrastructure risks in proof-of-stake blockchain networks (e. g. staking efficiency drops, slashing), by combining staking service level agreements, liquidity pools and programmable bonus-malus insurance payouts. Anyone can create a DSLA contract. Contract creators can claim rewards for pooling liquidity, if the performance of the monitored validator meets or exceeds pre-defined thresholds. Conversely, delegators can claim compensations for the bad performance of their validator. Thanks to Chainlink, DSLA contracts can now retrieve reliable validator performance data from decentralized staking analytics indexers to trigger insurance payouts, and source high-quality price data to calculate liquidity and insurance deposits, and current policy valuations. Chainlink is the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, securing over $4 Billion in value across DeFi by providing reliable, tamper-proof inputs and outputs for smart contracts on any blockchain. Given the importance of provisioning the most robust set of infrastructure for our users, we quickly identified Chainlink as essential oracle infrastructure to support our data-driven, fully automated decentralized service level agreements (DSLAs). A Commitment to Resilient Infrastructures: While there are increasingly more solutions available on the market, in our testing, our Chainlink integration proved to be a superior fit for building DSLA Protocol without single points of failure in its infrastructure. Infrastructure Resilience is a major design requirement for the DSLA Protocol mainnet, and one of the key reasons why we are building DSLAs on blockchain networks instead of resorting to centralized infrastructures like our competitors do. In order to fulfill our mission as a Service Governance vehicle, it is critical to design a risk management protocol that is not prone to the same reliability risks that it mitigates. Chainlink’s focus on Quality of Service offers strong guarantees that are aligned with such mission-critical design goals. Some of the features of particular importance that Chainlink brings to DSLA Protocol include:    Decentralized infrastructure at both the data source and oracle node level, leading to highly available and manipulation-resistant data and oracle services.     Flexibility to connect with any off-chain API, allowing DSLA smart contracts to retrieve Price Feeds and validator service performance data from premium data providers and any blockchain environment.     Access to security reviewed oracle nodes run by leading security and blockchain DevOps teams, ensuring reliable service with Sybil attack protection.     Proven mainnet solutions that secure billions of dollars in value for top blockchain-based applications, serving as definitive proof of the Chainlink Network’s security and reliability on mainnet.  How we use the Chainlink Oracle Network: DSLA Protocol relies on the Chainlink oracle network to perform 3 types of operations:    ① Display accurate, realtime price information in DSLA contracts so users can monitor their liquidity pools, hedges and policy valuations;     ② Convert users stakes and delegations into their DSLA and stablecoin equivalent to make liquidity and insurance deposits;     ③ Connect DSLA contracts with decentralized indexers during a contract verification to trigger insurance payouts.  We are looking forward to further collaborating with the Chainlink team on achieving our 2021 goals using their battle-tested network and technology.  DSLA Protocol gives Proof-of-Stake validators the ability to turn their operational excellence into a competitive advantage and differentiator, while reducing delegators exposure to staking infrastructure risks. Said Wilhem Pujar, CEO at Stacktical.  “By integrating Chainlink, our users have strong guarantees that DSLA contracts are triggered by accurate data in a manner that is highly available and resistant to various forms of data manipulation. This allows DSLA protocol to operate as a fully automated service governance vehicle that can be relied on to insure high-value stakes and delegations, in a rapidly growing staking industry. ” We look forward to further work with the Chainlink team and using their battle-tested network and technology to achieve our 2021 goals. About Chainlink: Chainlink is the most widely used and secure way to power universal smart contracts. With Chainlink, developers can connect any blockchain with high-quality data sources from other blockchains as well as real-world data. Managed by a global, decentralized community of hundreds of thousands of people, Chainlink is introducing a fairer model for contracts. Its network currently secures billions of dollars in value for smart contracts across the decentralized finance (DeFi), insurance and gaming ecosystems, among others. Chainlink is trusted by hundreds of organizations to deliver definitive truth via secure, reliable data feeds.

The 2nd and final part of this series will be posted on December 4th, 2020. Dear DSLA champions, all Phases of the DSLA incentivized beta have now been completed. It’s time to reflect on what happened for the past weeks! 🤔  There is no weekly monitoring cycle left.  Phase I-V staking compensations / rewards can be proven.  Phase I-V staking compensations / rewards will be claimable soon.

What an insightful ride this has been! The DSLA core development team has learned tremendously from the planned and unplanned failures that we have experienced during the different phases of the beta. In hindsight, we found a great balance between having just enough features working as expected to enable everyone to have an early taste of the hedging experience, and having features, infrastructure and operations that fail to various degrees, giving us clear pointers on what should be fixed, improved or dropped. We are coming out of this controlled test with a lot of data to crunch, and areas to improve and solidify for the mainnet releases and our 2021 roadmap (more about that soon). Here is a snapshot of the participation across all phases: 🔥 80 participants: 🔥 More than 560M bDSLA tokens claimed: 🔥 More than 160M bDSLA tokens staked: 🔥 More than 50K USD TVL (Total Value Locked on Nov 27): 🔥 On average 4. 3M bDSLA tokens staked per DSLA contract: 🔥 On average 2. 8 stakeholders per DSLA contract: 🔥 More than 60 DSLA contracts created: 🎯 Beta Objective: Remember? The objective of the DSLA incentivized beta was to validate the functional requirements of DSLA Protocol and DSLA. network, our flagship Ðapp, in preparation for their respective mainnet launch. To challenge our core team’s assumptions about what we must develop, the community was involved in a controlled usability test split across 5 weekly phases, designed to collect feedbacks about the Ðapp, iterate in real-time on the best ideas, and establish the final scope of the protocol to be audited by our security partner. 👍 The Good: Phase I and II proceeded as planned, with high levels of participation from the community, and active conversation on all communication channels. Especially on our Telegram. This enabled us to battle-test core features of DSLA Protocol and the DSLA. network Ðapp, namely:  The ability to create DSLA contracts The ability to stake (bDSLA) tokens to existing DSLA contracts Browsing through the DSLA contract marketplace, active pools and active hedges views👎 The Bad: Real-time developments have started stalling in Phase III. As we were working on withdrawals and claims we realised that the protocol’s time-based rules were not mature enough in their implementation, namely:  When should you be able to stake? withdraw? claim? How stakes, withdrawals and claims interact with each otherWe kept improving the overall usability of the Ðapp, but it is still missing:  A way to withdraw (bDSLA) stakes A way to claim bDSLA staking rewards for Phases I-V A way to track the evolution of SLILast but not least, we underestimated the difference in implementation between the networks we wanted to add support for, during the beta. Harmony, Polakdot and Band Protocol are different beasts, we had to adapt. 💪 The Fix: Withdrawals &amp; Claims Refactoring: At this stage, we have refactored about a third of the DSLA. network Ðapp to ship the features missing from the beta scope, and circumvent the current limitations present at the DSLA Protocol level. We can’t directly address these limitations by improving the DSLA Protocol smart contracts, because any protocol re-deployment would break compatibility with the beta DSLA contracts, as we are moving from the Ropsten test network to Kovan. Even if we were not changing networks, actively developping ways to migrate beta DSLA contracts to the new Kovan deployment would have been be a distraction from our roadmap. Instead, we will communicate the final status of the Ðapp developments in the Beta Outro Part 2 on December 4th. Architecture Deprecation: On December 1st at 3PM CET, we will introduce one of the major changes we are making to the DSLA Protocol architecture, to meet our requirements for the mainnet. ⏰ December 1st at 3PM CET, save the date. New Network Integration Policy: We are taking a bit of a top down approach, here. Moving forwards, we will primarily add support for blockchains of blockchains (e. g. Substrate/Polkadot), prior to adding support for the stand-alone networks that rely on them. Band Protocol being a Cosmos/Tendermint implementation, Cosmos (ATOM) support has been added to DSLA Protocol accordingly. 💡 Upcoming Features Spotlight: Here is a series of other identified issues that we are looking forward to fixing. #1 Markeplace Pagination: With the growing number of DSLA contracts, networks and validators, it is becoming hard to navigate through the marketplace. #2 Better Pool &amp; Hedge Tracking: Active pool and hedge views does not indicate how stakes are diversified across phases, and lack useful information. #3 Cross-Phase Stakes: Unused stakes remain bound to their Phase instead of being carried over to the new Phase. The Ðapp will remain available: The DSLA. network Ðapp will remain up, running and improving until mainnet launch. Past testers and newcomers alike will have plenty of time and opportunity to try new features as they are released to the Koven test network. See you in Outro Part 2, where we will wrap things up and officialize the next steps of the DSLA Protocol roadmap. ___ About DSLA Protocol: DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

    "title": "2 Billion DSLA Token Burn Event",
    "body": "2020/11/22 - Disco Inferno: On November 30, 11:11 CET, Stacktical, the core development team of DSLA Protocol, will proceed with a 2,000,000,000. 00 (2 Billion) DSLA token burn as part of its Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) Mitigation Plan, and to further pave the way to the DSLA Protocol and DSLA. network Ðapp mainnet launches this year. Here are 5 key information you absolutely need to know about the event: 1. ☝️ Total Supply will decrease to 7B DSLA: DSLA tokens have been issued in the Billions, for the DSLA Protocol to empower use cases across a wide variety of industries beyond staking, and settle breached / honoured DSLA contracts using integer numbers. After the event, the maximum number of DSLA tokens in existence will be 7,000,000,000. 00 (7 Billion) DSLA, a 22. 2% decrease from 9,000,000,000. 00 (9 Billion). 2. ✌️ Circulating Supply will cross 90% of Total Supply: Most of the DSLA tokens burned during the event are not circulating. Not only the current number of DSLA tokens circulating on the market will not be affected by the DSLA token burn event, but this number will also increase and cross 90% of all DSLA tokens in existence. More than ever, our tokenomics will send a strong signal that our community is ready to write the next chapter of DSLA Protocol and the DSLA family of products. 3. 🤟 Current Individual Holdings will increase by 28. 57%: By decreasing the DSLA Total Supply by 22. 2%, each DSLA Holders will equally hold 28. 57% more of the fully diluted Market Cap of DSLA. For example, an individual holding 30M DSLA will see her holding percentage increase from 0. 33% to 0. 42%. A provable increase in community power. 4. 🍀 Current Core Team Holdings will decrease by 70%: The increase in community power is the result of our core development team, and selected partners, agreeing to decrease their own DSLA holdings. Here is a breakdown of our commitment : (TBB = To Be Burned) 👝 Company Reserve :300,000,000. 00 (300M) DSLA TBB 🔥 🎒 Core Team Wallet :1,100,000,000. 00 (1. 1B) DSLA TBB 🔥 💼 Team &amp; Partners :600,000,000. 00 (600M) DSLA TBB 🔥 5. 👋 DSLA Total Supply will keep decreasing over time: DSLA Protocol has a built-in token burn mechanism. On the mainnet, DSLA contract bonus claims involving liquidity pools in DSLA tokens will trigger a DSLA utility burn, to incentivize DSLA stakeholders. Where to buy DSLA: We recommend 1inch, as the premier way to buy DSLA tokens at the best possible price. Here is the full list of decentralized exchanges and trading services where you can buy DSLA:       Type        Status   Exchange         Initial Pool   Genesis of the DSLA DEX Pools   Created    Uniswap       Bridge Pool 1   Extension of the DSLA DEX Pools   Created    Mooniswap       Bridge Pool 2   Extension of the DSLA DEX Pools   Created    Balancer       DEX Aggregator   Combination of all DSLA DEX Pools   Listed    1nch       DEX Listing   DEX alternative to DSLA DEX Pools   Listed    IDEX   About DSLA Protocol: DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

    "body": "2020/11/14 - Not your Private Keys, Not your DSLA Tokens: The purpose of this Suspicion Activity Report (SAR) is to disclose the existence of transactions that do not make sense to our team, as well as introduce an emergency plan to mitigate their impact on the DSLA Token, and the rest of the DSLA family of products. 📅 November 13, 2020: It was brought to our attention that large amounts of DSLA tokens originating from the ProBit liquidity pool have been sold on Uniswap, in highly automated ways. 📅 November 14, 2020: Per our initial investigation, it is indeed unlikely that a human trader would withdraw DSLA tokens from ProBit, then swap DSLA tokens for USDT on Uniswap, in such a short amount of time (2 minutes), and on repeated, systematic occasions. ⚠️ Intermediate conclusion: Burried in otherwise valid transactions, the 0xc9cae208c7a00b000bbb4bd0645dd170623e9526 wallet involved in these swaps is either exerting price manipulation, or turning a profit through aggressive arbitrage. We have reached to the ProBit team for clarification, as we lack the elements to clearly establish responsibilities at this stage. Mitigation Plan: There is no reliable model for quantifying the impact of programmatic sell-offs on the price of assets and their market capitalization. But we can still harden DSLA against suppression, manipulation, and trading abuse, by:  A) Recapturing lost value by reducing DSLA’s total supply; B) Parting ways with our centralized cryptocurrency exchanges; C) Adding liquidity and creating new LP incentives across all DEX pools. A) 🔥 2B+ DSLA Token Burn: On November 30, 2020, we will proceed with a 2,000,000,000. 00 DSLA token burn using our personal, team, company and participating partners wallets. All other DSLA holders will benefit from the increase in scarcity / decrease in total supply of DSLA. In that same spirit, we will also inaugurate a new section on the DSLA Protocol official website, dedicated to:  The tracking of your DSLA holdings; The updated DSLA token distribution and the detailed purpose of company wallets; The monitoring of DSLA transactions. These information also aim at increasing the overall auditability of the project, in preparation for our mainnet launch. B) 🤝 Trusted Trading Platforms: As we are figuring out the ins and outs of the sell-off with the ProBit team, we strongly advise you do not deposit any funds to the exchange, and consider withdrawing your funds as soon as possible.

This incident further puts that effort in perspective. We will make it one of our priorities from now on. What’s next?:  We will publish a new SAR once ProBit answers our questions We will provide additional details about the 2B DSLA token burnThanks for the unwavering support, champions. 💪 Make sure you join the conversation on Telegram.

The MY AGREEMENTS section only displays created DSLA Contracts, which somehow helped Validators keep track of the liquidity they added to their own contracts. But as a a Delegator, you had no direct access to your active hedges. Accordingly, we will:    Open up the HEDGEsection to keep track of active hedges against staking risks as a Delegator;     Open up the POOL section to keep track of active compensation pool deposits;     Display both active hedges and active compensation pool deposits in the MY AGREEMENTS section.

    "body": "2020/08/28 - Earn rewards for protecting DOT staking deposits against staking risks: Dear DSLA Champions, our team is proud to announce that we are adding support for the Polkadot network to the DSLA Protocol! Polkadot relies on a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) system, where nominators back validators with their own stake as a show of faith in the good behavior of the validator. During the upcoming DSLA Incentivized Beta, DSLA contracts will provide DOT token nominators with a decentralized hedge against slashing, staking efficiency drops and late reward payouts, while enabling anyone to earn rewards for protecting DOT staking deposits against staking risks.  This will allow DSLA to enable Polkadot validators to become provably trustworthy validators, even if they lack the track record and brand recognition to convince nominators to back them. Note that, although we share common goals with the Polkadot team, we are not official Polkadot partners. Polkadot hasn’t officially endorsed the DSLA incentivized beta. That being said, adding DOT staking insurance to the DSLA protocol is in line with the scope of our Polkadot W3F grant, and the work initiated on Parachain scalability and service level management since February 2020. You can expect more news related to the Polkadot ecosystem in the coming weeks, as we’re finishing up developments and solidify the final scope of the DSLA architecture.  About the DSLA Incentivized Beta Test: On September 30th 2020, DSLA core developers are organizing an incentivized beta to validate the functional, performance, reliability and security assumptions of the DSLA. network decentralized application that integrates DSLA Protocol, before tentatively launching both products on the mainnet on November 30th 2020. Beta participants will be rewarded using beta bDSLA tokens that they will be converted to real, mainnet DSLA tokens upon launch. To follow the news about the DSLA Incentivized Beta, feel free to subscribe to the project’s dedicated Product Hunt page, and join the ongoing conversation on Telegram. The DSLA core development team will share more information about the beta roadmap very soon. About our Polkadot W3F Grant: Polkadot is a blockchain network that provides shared security and secure messaging to Parachains, plug-and-play specialized blockchain, with parallelizable computations. Its architecture is a departure from generalized programmable blockchain that empower a wide variety of use cases at the expense of scalability. Fundamental scalability bottlenecks remain in Polkadot, though. The fact that there will be a finite number of Parachains on the network upon launch is proof that limitations exist: While the capacity boost in using parallel Parachain computation is substantial, ensuring that they remain up, synced, and secure does cost resources. As a Polkadot researcher, part of your job is to figure out these resource requirements and drive architectural decisions (e. g. allocating a specific number Parachain slots) through repeated performance benchmarks, in various protocol configuration and transactional scenarios. But rather than spending weeks running thousands of performance benchmarks, and manually interpret their result, what if you could let your machine could figure out the scalability of your system itself using mathematical models, and very few performance measurements? That is exactly what we set out to do with willitscale-polkadot. Read the official announcement.

    "body": "2020/08/24 - Earn rewards for protecting BAND staking deposits against staking risks: Dear DSLA Champions, our team is proud to announce that we are adding support for the Band Protocol BandChain network to the DSLA Protocol! 🎉 Powered by their in-house BandChain proof-of-stake network and the BAND token, Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts. During the upcoming DSLA Incentivized Beta, DSLA contracts will provide BAND token delegators with a decentralized hedge against slashing, staking efficiency drops and late reward payouts, while enabling anyone to earn rewards for protecting BAND staking deposits against staking risks. Although delegating your BAND tokens to a third-party staking service is easier than operating a BandChain node yourself, doing so exposes you to unfortunate losses and missed rewards. DSLA contracts are an elegant, symmetric governance vehicle to effortlessly manage this incumbent risk without legal, customer support and insurance intermediaries. DSLA is Powered by Band Protocol: It is our great pleasure to announce that the Band Protocol data oracle will also empower the enforcement of DSLA smart contracts, by connecting our protocol to the staking analytics of our decentralized performance monitoring data indexer. As originally planned in our official white paper two years ago, we have been actively looking forward to integrating the best possible data oracle service to the cross-chain DSLA architecture that relies on the Ethereum and Polkadot decentralized ledgers. The Band Protocol team has been the only one to demonstrate a world class ability to accompany us during the integration process, and cope with our demands as we were figuring out the user experience of the DSLA. network DApp. We will be looking forward to continuously improve our data oracle integration, and our collaboration with Band Protocol, as we are journeying to the mainnet launch of DSLA Protocol! 🤟 About the DSLA Incentivized Beta Test: On September 30th 2020, DSLA core developers are organizing an incentivized beta to validate the functional, performance, reliability and security assumptions of the DSLA. network decentralized application that integrates DSLA Protocol, before tentatively launching both products on the mainnet on November 30th 2020. Beta participants will be rewarded using beta bDSLA tokens that they will be converted to real, mainnet DSLA tokens upon launch. To follow the news about the DSLA Incentivized Beta, feel free to subscribe to the project’s dedicated Product Hunt page, and join the ongoing conversation on Telegram. The DSLA core development team will share more information about the beta roadmap very soon. About Band Protocol: Band Protocol is a cross-chain data oracle platform that aggregates and connects real-world data and APIs to smart contracts. Blockchains are great at immutable storage and deterministic, verifiable computations — however, they cannot securely access data available outside the blockchain networks. Band Protocol enables smart contract applications such as DeFi, prediction markets, and games to be built on-chain without relying on the single point of failure of a centralized oracle. Band Protocol is backed by a strong network of stakeholders including Sequoia Capital, one of the top venture capital firms in the world, and the leading cryptocurrency exchange, Binance.

    "body": "2020/08/18 - When Liquidity? DSLA. finance is LIVE: Dear champions, we have been thinking for a while about how we could enable everyone in the community to contribute more actively to the DSLA family of products. One of our key objectives as the DSLA Core Team is to ensure that users ultimately have a greater say about DSLA Protocol and its DApps, than us. DSLA needs to fulfil its mission through the power of network participation and open source contribution. Through your power. As we hinted over the past few week, we have been experimenting a new Community Program called the DSLA Residency, designed to empower you to shape the future of the project using Github (mostly). Today, we are proud to announce that one of the first contributions to the Program is ready for primetime, and that the DSLA Residency is entering the final phase of its private Pilot, before we start publicy onboarding new Residents. Meet the DSLA Community Faucet: Borrowed from Ampleforth’s Geyser DApp, the DSLA Community Faucet is a smart faucet that rewards users in DSLA tokens, for providing liquidity on the official DSLA-ETH pair on Uniswap. The more DSLA liquidity you provide on Uniswap, and for longer, the greater share of the faucet pool you receive. Made in Residency: One of our DSLA Resident Developer thought this DeFi solution would be a perfect answer to the “When liquidity?” question the community has been (repeatedly) asking for the past two weeks. With the growing interest for what we’re building, it is indeed a very relevant question to ask. Familiar with farming and liquidity mining techniques, he suggested, studied, and shipped a solution that is now hosted at DSLA. finance, and that is already improving the liquidity and trading conditions on Uniswap (since the faucet news leaked earlier today 😅).  For his tremendous contribution, the DSLA Resident Developer has been rewarded with 4,206,900 DSLA from the Community Reserve, that is used to handle all liquidity matters, including but not limited to facilitating trades on available DSLA markets while increasing its circulating supply. For the time being, we plan on allocating a total of 100M DSLA to operate the full Residency Program. Our team is looking forward to confirming the exact allocation soon, and sharing more information about the Program’s official launch. For now, please hit the deck, for a quick overview of what the Residency is about. Important Security Considerations:    The faucet works with a new, unmodified deployment of the open source Solidity contract of Ampleforth’s Geyser, fully audited by CertiK in this report.     The DSLA Community Faucet smart contract is deployed at this address, while Ampleforth’s Geyser can found here.  If you compare the two contracts with a difference checking tool like this one, you will be quickly able to assess with certainty that they are identical.     The DApp at https://dsla. finance, connected to our own Geyser deployment has been reverse engineered from Ampleforth’s Geyser DApp. Our DSLA Resident thought it was faster to rely on an existing UI rather that developing an original one. We tend to agree.     Even though we took all the necessary steps to ensure that what our Resident has shipped works as intended, please exercise extra caution when using the Community Faucet, whether you’re interacting through the DApp or directly interact with the smart contract itself. Always double check the address of the smart contract you are interacting with on MetaMask.     Make sure you read Ampleforth’s Geyser documentation to know how things work. Our very own is coming soon.  Faucet Token Release Schedule: The DSLA Community Faucet has initially been filled with 15M DSLA, rewarded over 15 days. Before the faucet expires on September 1st, 2020, and if it is deemed useful (and has the statistics to prove it), we will proceed with adding a more sizeable contribution to the Community Faucet pool, and further accompany the growth of liquidity on Uniswap for the rest of the year.

    "body": "2020/08/15 - Earn rewards for protecting ONE staking deposits against staking risks: This post has been adapted from the official Harmony announcement on Medium. If you do not want to operate your own Harmony node to earn staking rewards, you can outsource this task to a third-party staking and validation service. But while delegating your ONE tokens is easier than validating Harmony blocks yourself, it exposes you to the potential bad behaviour and the unfulfilled reliability promises of your validator. This might lead you to missing rewards because of downtimes, and losing a fraction of your staking deposit because of double-sign slashing penalties. That’s where DSLA comes in. As you know, DSLA Protocol is a new DeFi initiative that aims at solving this dilemma, and mitigating protocol violations, by adding a decentralized insurance layer on top of the staking activity of proof-of-stake blockchain networks. By combining an onchain alternative to third-party outsourcing contracts called service level agreements, and programmable cryptocurrency payouts, DSLA Protocol enables anyone to effortlessly hedge against staking risks, and passively earn rewards for protecting staking deposits. DSLA Protocol (DSLA) x Harmony (ONE): On September 30th 2020, DSLA core developers are organizing an incentivized beta to validate the functional, performance, reliability and security assumptions of the dsla. network decentralized application that integrates DSLA Protocol, before tentatively launching both products on the mainnet on November 30th 2020. Beta participants will be rewarded using DSLA tokens with actual market value. Harmony is the first proof-of-stake blockchain network to be officially supported by the DSLA protocol during the DSLA incentivized beta, and for the upcoming mainnet. Our teams will join forces to make staking ONE tokens rank amongst the safest and most rewarding staking experiences in the industry.

    "title": "Announcing the DSLA Incentivized Beta Test: Road to Mainnet",
    "body": "2020/07/24 - Beta Test, Real Rewards: If you are interested in what’s happening behind the scenes of cryptocurrency staking, you might have had the opportunity to contribute to incentivized testnets, test blockchain networks that reward their participants using cryptocurrency with actual market value. By making testing new blockchain networks less asymmetric between users and developers (users get rewarded for the time they pour into testing new product developments), incentivized testnets have emerged as a compelling way to attract the first Validators and Delegators of new proof-of-stake projects, and bootstrap their security by producing and endorsing their first series of blocks. In that spirit, to better align the interest of the community (earn DSLA rewards and DSLA compensations) with the interest of core DSLA developers (product-market fit), we are proud to announce that we will be organizing a DSLA incentivized beta test using a test version of the DSLA Network, the first decentralized application implementing the DSLA Protocol.  On September 30th 2020, the DSLA Network DApp hosted of the Ropsten Ethereum network will reward beta participants using DSLA tokens with actual market value. For our team, your contribution will be the perfect chance to validate the functional, performance, reliability and security assumptions of the DSLA Network before launching on the mainnet on November 30th 2020. The DSLA Incentivized Beta Test: By outsourcing block production and endorsement to third party staking providers, Delegators do not need to operate their own blockchain node to earn staking rewards. But at the same time, they are exposed to the potential bad behaviour and unfulfilled reliability promises of Validators. This puts their staking deposit at risk of being depleted (slashing penalty). DSLA Protocol is a decentralized alternative to SLA contracts for derisking staking services. It enables anyone to vouch for the reliability of a staking service, earn rewards when the staking service performs as expected, and claim financial compensation when the staking service doesn’t meet expectations. A test ERC-20 token called bDSLA will be issued on the Ethereum test network, to specifically empower the DSLA Incentivized Beta Test. Just like their real counterpart, bDSLA tokens will be used to pay for the periodic verification of DSLA contracts, and empower the reward / compensation scenarios of the DSLA Protocol.  When the protocol launches on the mainnet this year, bDSLA token holders will then be able to convert their bDSLA rewards and compensation into real DSLA tokens. Starring Harmony (ONE) and more: The DSLA Incentivized Beta will exemplify how the DSLA Protocol provides a decentralized way to derisks the staking experience of some of the best blockchain networks out there. We are excited to announce that Harmony ONE staking deposits will be amongst the first assets supported by DSLA Protocol during the incentivized beta test! About Harmony: Harmony is a fast and open blockchain for decentralized applications. Through secure and random state sharding, the Harmony Mainnet supports thousands of nodes that produce blocks in a few seconds with instant finality. The protocol’s Effective Proof-of-Stake (EPoS) staking mechanism reduces centralization while supporting stake delegation, reward compounding and double-sign slashing. Harmony x DSLA Protocol: During the DSLA Incentivized Beta Test, ONE Delegators will be able to easily hedge against Validators downtimes and double-sign slashing risks, by signing Staking Efficiency DSLA contracts and staking bDSLA tokens in the reward pool. In parallel, anyone on the Internet will be able to earn bDSLA tokens for protecting ONE Delegators from downtimes and double-sign slashing, by creating Staking Efficiency DSLA contracts and staking bDSLA tokens in the compensation pool. Staking Efficiency is the percentage of realized rewards by a Validator. How it works: In practice, every n days, DSLA contracts compare the measured staking efficiency of a Validator, with the efficiency objective defined in the Staking Efficiency DSLA contract then :    DSLA Rewards are distributed to contract owners and staking service providers, if the staking efficiency of the designated Validator does not drop below the defined objective;     DSLA Compensations are distributed to contract enrollees, if the staking effiency of the designated Validator drops below the defined objective.  We can wait to see how DSLA will improve the delegation experience of the Harmony community and the Quality of Service of Harmony ONE staking service providers.  More assets planned for the beta launch: Along with Harmony’s ONE, other popular proof-of-stake assets will be unveiled during the weeks preceeding the DSLA Incentivited Beta. Ever since the project’s inception, we have been talking with world class teams like Harmony to bring Decentralized IT Service Management (ITSM) and Customer Service practices to the DeFi and Open Finance industry. Participating in the Beta: As easy as 1-2-3: Until the comprehensive Incentivized Beta Test documentation is ready and available, here’s an overview on how to get started with the DSLA Network DApp upon beta launch. It will mostly consist of three simple steps. ☝️ STEP 1) Acquire bDSLA tokens: The first time you connect your wallet to the beta, your bDSLA token balance will be synced once with your real DSLA token balance. N. B. If you are not a DSLA token holder just yet, you will need to first become one. ✌️ STEP 2) Stake bDSLA tokens: Once your bDSLA token balance is synced, you will be able to :    Sign an existing DSLA contract and stake bDSLA to its DSLA Reward Pool;     Create a new DSLA contract and stake bDSLA to setup a new DSLA Compensation Pool.  🤟 STEP 3) Compound bDSLA rewards: Extra bDSLA tokens will be periodically claimable by the users that created or signed a DSLA contract, according to the measured Staking Efficiency of the Validator designated in the contract. .

As we celebrate our third anniversary right in the middle of an unprecedented global crisis, it is humbling to be still around and kicking, more dedicated than ever to sustain the development of DSLA Protocol and the entire family of DSLA products. Happy birthday to us and courage to our friends going through difficult times right now. It’s never been more important to care about your customers, and we will keep providing support to the industries that need to reinvent themselves in order to show demonstrable care as an inherent part of their customer experience, and look forward to optimize their financial and non-financial revenue using the DSLA Protocol and the DSLA Network DApp. If you’re staking service provider or an individual validator, interested in joining our growing list of launch partners, please check out our official partner deck at this address. Among other perks, early commitments to use DSLA Protocol as an official launch partners will grant you reduced maintenance fees for SLA checks. Let’s chat ! A quick look at what kept us busy lately: Products: Stacktical Website: Version 4. 0. 0 stacktical. com       Task    Status         Specifications   80%       Developments   20%       Quality Assurance   0%       Release ETA   June 30th    The new Stacktical website is being developed right now. We’re often mistaken for an insurance solution. It is very much understandable since a SLA contracts protects customers against unforeseen events using financial incentives, often in the form of service credits. But service level agreements are first and foremost a governance vehicle for service providers, meaning it’s a framework to design and make decisions to consistently meet quality standards when it comes to delivering data, services, goods and transporting people. The upcoming version 4. 0. 0 of the Stacktical Website aims at demonstrating the capabilities of DSLA Protocol in various industries, and better articulate the benefits of decentralizing a SLA contract, compared to existing centralized Service Level Management (SLM) solutions. Visit the Stacktical Website Stacktical Blog: Version 2. 1. 0 blog. stacktical. com  No new developments for the Stacktical Blog this month.

Our objective with the release of DSLA Protocol version 2. 0. 1 was to provide an end-to-end uptime SLA scenario where a user could be easily compensated for the downtimes of a given website. Feedbacks from the community has helped us identify several issues and areas of improvements that needs to be addressed through a new release. DSLA Protocol version 2. 1. 0 aims at integrating our new Oracle partner to ensure reliable, decentralized periodic SLA checks, and the automated enforcement of SLA policies (e. g. monthly downtime compensation in DSLA token).

The flagship use case of DSLA Protocol is to secure staking rewards against slashing penalties and unfulfilled reliability promises. It’s a great way for staking service providers to meet quality standards and de-risk staking for their delegators. While this is something we’re already explicitely mentioning on the DSLA Network homepage, the Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks and assets that will be supported by the protocol have yeat to appear somewhere on the DApp. Version 0. 9. 0 of DSLA Network will introduce a series of change in the SLA creation workflow, and introduce a Staking SLA along with the existing Uptime SLA. Wilhem has discussed with the top management of the world’s best staking service providers to establish a list of priority networks and assets that should be made available at launch. It goes without saying that we plan on supporting Kusama and Polkadot from the get-go, as we’re working on our W3F grant assignments.

    "body": "2020/02/12 - Will it scale ?: Polkadot is a blockchain network that provides shared security and secure messaging to Parachains, plug-and-play specialized blockchain, with parallelizable computations. Its architecture is a departure from generalized programmable blockchain that empower a wide variety of use cases at the expense of scalability. Fundamental scalability bottlenecks remain in Polkadot, though. The fact that there will be a finite number of Parachains on the network upon launch is proof that limitations exist: While the capacity boost in using parallel Parachain computation is substantial, ensuring that they remain up, synced, and secure does cost resources. As a Polkadot researcher, part of your job is to figure out these resource requirements and drive architectural decisions (e. g. allocating a specific number Parachain slots) through repeated performance benchmarks, in various protocol configuration and transactional scenarios. But rather than spending weeks running thousands of performance benchmarks, and manually interpret their result, what if you could let your machine could figure out the scalability of your system itself using mathematical models, and very few performance measurements? That is exactly what we set out to do with willitscale-polkadot. willitscale-polkadot: Stacktical was originally a scalability prediction platform for DevOps professionals. Our R&amp;D efforts in the past three years enabled us to apply mathematical and statistical models to application and network benchmarks, and surface what humans can hardly (or simply can’t) guess from analyzing performance benchmarks.  By establishing that a given system was experiencing 24% contention and 8% coherency overheads, we were empowering DevOps teams with tangible scalability numbers they could communicate and improve on. When we shifted the company’s focus to enabling anyone to roll out peer-to-peer, electronic SLA contracts on the blockchain, we naturally started thinking about how we could leverage predictive analytics with blockchain networks. Stumbling upon this article has been instrumental in confirming that similar overheads had been observed by Polkadot researchers. As the Parachain count increase, it appears the network throughput should theoretically reach a natural upper bound (diminishing returns from contention overhead) before declining (negative return from incoherency). The scalability chart of publicly available benchmarks of a private Ethereum network. For illustration purpose only. What’s next ?: The second milestone on our roadmap is to add predictive capabilities to the polkadot-deployer :  Throughput measurement capability based on balance transfers Latency measurement capability based on balance transfers A new benchmark option to run predictive analysis on measurementsThese changes will enable willitscale-polkadot users to effortlessly collect Substrate / Polkadot benchmark results to feed the predictive engine.  We would like to thank the web3 foundation for supporting our development efforts of the first blockchain scalability prediction platform for Polkadot network researchers. We’re hoping that willitscale-polkadot will pave the way to faster, more quality development of decentralized products based on Polkadot, Substrate and more.

    "body": "2020/01/15 - Happy New Year to the Stacktical Community !: What better way to start 2020, than reflecting on last year’s achievements, and setting ever bigger goals for ourselves? Thank you for sticking with us through our crazy journey, and best of wishes for this new decade.  10. We crossed 1000 DSLA holders: More than 1000 early adopters acquired DSLA tokens in 2019. It has been an important milestone for Stacktical, considering that service level agreements are relatively unknown to the general public. As expected, the technical and business expertise required to assess the potential of decentralized service level agreements and cryptocurrency service credits, has limited the adoption of the DSLA token. But it has also forced us to review our copy, and better articulate our vision for the future. By focusing DSLA Network on rolling out service level agreements between proof-of-stake validators and delegators, we are expecting to grow our DSLA holders tenfold this year.  9. A new, updated vision is born: From the project inception, we have always defined Stacktical as a Platform: a combination of service management products working together. But last year, we realised that we were in fact building a true Protocol: a set of rules governing the exchange of data and value between stakeholders. This means :  DSLA Token is the currency of the DSLA Protocol DSLA Network, our flagship product, is the 1st implementation of the DSLA Protocol Other teams could implement DSLA Protocol to build their own SLA-based experiences2020 will be the perfect opportunity to introduce our plans, regarding the latter point.  8. DSLA has been listed on its 1st exchange: You need DSLA tokens to roll out, upgrade and enforce service level agreements on DSLA Network, or use DSLA Protocol in your own implementations. Listing DSLA on its 1st exchange has provided a simple, initial way of acquiring DSLA tokens, in preparation for the Q2 2020 launch of the Protocol mainnet. As per our roadmap, more listings are to be expected in 2020. We strongly advise you stay tuned on Telegram for announcements.  7. DSLA has been listed on coin trackers: In 2019 and following its listing on a cryptocurrency exchange, DSLA made its first appearance on coin discovery services such as CoinGecko or CryptoCompare.       Coin Tracker    Link         CoinGecko   Here       Coin Codex   Here       Coinpaprika   Here       CryptoCompare   Here       Nomics   Here   Getting listed on CoinMarketCap, the leading coin tracker, will require additional exchange listings, and consistent trading activity. This will be a core area of focus for the year ahead and we will make sure update the community once we meet these requirements.  6. We released a new website: During Summer 2019, our co-founders felt the urge to challenge the Product and Technology story that we want like to tell with the Stacktical Platform. A gazillion drawings, discussions and aha moments later, we introduced a new website that better articulates what the DSLA Protocol, the DSLA Token and the DSLA Network initiatives helps us fulfill our mission as a Service Governance company. Visit the new Stacktical Website 5. We won an innovation award: In November 2019, Stacktical has received an Overseas Innovation Prize, during the 2019 edition of the Innovation Outremer competition at STATION F, the world’s biggest startup campus. We would like to renew our thanks to Daniel Hierso, his team at Outremer Network, Orange, and all the partners that made this recognition possible. We’re humbled by your trust in our vision for the future of service governance, and we’re dedicated to making it a reality.  4. We released the DSLA Protocol β: DSLA is an autonomous service level agreement protocol built for service providers, to offer provable service level guarantees to customers, better adapt to changing service level needs, and effortlessly mitigate the economic impact of bad service levels. As a protocol, its purpose is to be implemented into various products using a Software Development Kit (SDK). DSLA Network, our flagship product, is the first decentralized application to implement DSLA Protocol to solve the specific problem of cascade slashing for Proof-of-Stake network participants.  3. We released the DSLA Network β: In 2019, more than 25% of Blockchain networks used the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) security model instead of (Bitcoin’s) Proof-of-Work (PoW). Sign of the new decade to come? In a Proof-of-Stake network, transactions are validated and securely added to the blockchain by network participants called Validators. Any network participant can become a Validator, by making a cryptocurrency security deposit called a Stake. Stakes entitle Validators to timely Block Rewards, in exchange for securing the network.  If other participants want to help secure the network without becoming Validators, they can delegate their Stake to the Validators of their choice, and earn a fraction of the Block Reward in return. The problem is that Validators that fail to meet the reliability requirements of a Proof-of-Stake network expose themselves and their Delegators to financial penalties.  This is known as the slashing risk. Powered by DSLA Protocol, DSLA Network is a decentralized web application to protect Tezos Nominators and PoS Delegators against losing their cryptocurrency stake, when their Tezos Bakers and PoS Validators miss blocks, or misbehave on the network. Staking on DSLA Network enables Tezos Nominators and PoS Delegators to enrol in slashing compensation programs. DSLA Protocol will automatically compensate program enrolees upon missed blocks and slashing events, and will automatically reward program owners, to:  Incentivize Quality of Service over time; Increase their self-bonding capacity; Accept more Tezos Nominators and Pos Delegators. 🏆 Win-Win ! Read the deck 2. We won a grant from a top blockchain foundation: We have received a Research &amp; Development grant from one of the most respectables blockchain foundations in the industry, to work on three open source products aiming at improving the experience of their Proof-of-Stake network participants, and the experience of their blockchain researchers. These products will pave the way to more decentralization and more interoperability in the DSLA architecture, especially when it comes to monitoring onchain block validation metrics, to enforce block agreements between PoS Validators and Delegators. We will make sure to share more details about the grant and the full scope of the project, in a dedicated article, as soon as we’re properly authorized to disclose this initiative.  1. We partnered with companies we admire: In 2019, we have interviewed hundreds of incredible service providers, in order to fine-tune our understanding of their SLA management needs. This focused effort has been instrumental in validating and dismissing the product assumptions we had made until then, and getting to the bottom of what the DSLA Network should be about, from the perspective of true DevOps professionals. Today, we have onboarded several new providers with our revamped approach, and are very excited to work with them over the course of the year 2020.

    "body": "2019/12/16 - When new exchange ?: 🎉 Edit: We have officially left P2PB2B for STEX. 🎉 Edit: DSLA/USDT debuts trading on ProBit. 🎉 Edit: DSLA/USDT debuts trading on Bilaxy. As an early stage business-to-business initiative, with a legitimate use of blockchain and decentralized ledger technologies, the Stacktical Platform has definitely room for adoption. And we’re well aware that we have a lot to learn to achieve our goals as a company. 6 months after our initial appearance on the P2PB2B cryptocurrency exchange, the trading activity of the DSLA token have yet to meet the expectations of our community stakeholders. While this first listing put our company on the cryptocurrency map, and was undoubtedly an important step in the right direction, DSLA needs to be more liquid to fulfill its mission as the utility token of the DSLA Protocol, and empower reward, compensation and staking scenarios on the Platform. Thankfully, and with the help of our community, we have been exploring several new listing opportunities with this liquidity objective in mind. The result of this effort is a series of regulatory-compliant DSLA listing milestones, that closely follow the development maturity of the collection of smart contracts empowering Stacktical.

Real DSLA tokens   At maximum Network Maturity, real DSLA tokens are used by the protocol to empower production applications. While we originally planned for a major listing in December, there is simply too much blood in the streets, and too little fundamentals, to support this decision at this time. With an intermediary listing and increased liquidity, DSLA will also have a greater chance to meet CoinMarketCap’s listing requirements, and dramatically expand the global reach of the Stacktical project.

The Stacktical website is the home of the Stacktical company, and the gateway to the different components of the Stacktical Platform.   As such, it is our responsibility to make sure it conveys clear corporate and product information to our private contributors, our developer and cryptocurrency community, our customers and an increasingly diverse crowd of project stakeholders. In order to be aligned enough with the evolving direction of the Stacktical project, we put the Stacktical Website developments on hold during Summer, and focused on challenging the Product and Technology story that we want like to tell. A gazillion drawings, discussions and aha moments later, it is time to re-introduce DSLA to the world, and our new website definitely does set the tone for greater things moving forward.

DeFi introduces the ability for anyone to roll-out traditional financial products (e. g. loans), and reap their benefits (e. g. interests) on a decentralized network like the Ethereum blockchain. Lately, we’ve been experimenting on adding DeFi capabilities to SLAs, to address some of the design challenges that comes with decentralized service governance. The illiquid nature of SLA compensation pool, for example. These experiments turned out to be a great way to improve how we’re breaking down the Stacktical Platform into products, and exactly what product should represent our project. Originally, we planned on positionning the DSLA Network application as our flagship product. But it led the community into believe that we were simply developing a decentralized application, while we were in fact building a fully-fledged governance protocol. In the Stacktical Platform architecture, a collection of smart contracts support the DSLA Network application behind the scenes. To put our blockchain development at the forefront, we’ve decided to officialize the DSLA protocol as our core component.  DSLA Protocol is the simplest expression of what we’re really doing: building an autonomous governance protocol for developers like ourselves, willing to roll-out, bargain and enforce service level agreements at scale. Along with empowering the DSLA Network application, we can’t wait to see how SaaS and other applications can leverage the DSLA Protocol to supercharge their SLA contracting and reliability engineering practices.

    "body": "2019/09/21 - The definite guide to your high-performance IPFS GatewaySo you want to store and fetch your public IPFS Assets with no compromise of speed and reliability while participating in strengthening the network? You are at the right place!We compiled the essential bits so you can get this done quickly. What’s IPFS?The Interplanetary File System is exactly what the name says, a distributed file system to replace the centralized HTTP Web that we know. This is how Stacktical’s IPFS server is used to our own platform’s Dapp (15s faster add operations for a lightweight JSON payload vs Infura’s). We limited the domain that accesses our node with CORS and used an Nginx encrypted proxy to handle HTTPS connections to IPFS. Turnkey solutions like Infura’s IPFS Gateway and Pinata are great to start and to give IPFS a try but everyone should avoid Centralized Services to access decentralized services (which defeat the purpose of Decentralization and don’t provide the performance and reliability you need for your (D)app. This article will cover:  The complete setup of a Cloud instance to run our IPFS node How to make your node securely available for your (D)appIPFS Server setup: We are leveraging Google Cloud Platform so this article will cover setup on a compute instance type n1-standard-1 with Debian OS but it’s pretty much straightforward on other Cloud vendors and Linux Oses. Here we create an instance with HTTP and HTTPS allowed in the firewall section (We will have an HTTP -&gt; HTTPS redirect).  Or with the GCP SDK: gcloud compute --project=stacktical-0 instances create ipfs-node-1 --zone=us-central1-b --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --image-project=debian-cloud --boot-disk-size=10GB --boot-disk-type=pd-standard --tags=http-server,https-server Storage layer: Our Node Storage need will most likely grow in size, so it’s better to give our node a dedicated Volume for flexibility and extra persistency: Add a persistent disk to your IPFS Node instance and mount it. That’s how our node fstab entry looked like: UUID=[DISK_UUID] /mnt/disks/[MNT_DIR] ext4 discard,defaults,nofail 0 2 Where:  [DISK_UUID] is the Disk Unique Id obtained with the blkid command.  [MNT_DIR] is the directory where the ipfs volume will be mounted, /mnt/disk/ipfs-disk/ in our case. Set the Volume location for IPFS to make use of it: 1234echo 'export IPFS_PATH=/mnt/disk/ipfs-disk/ipfs' &gt;&gt;~/. bash_profilesource ~/. bash_profilesudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu $IPFS_PATH/*mkdir $IPFS_PATH/ipfsYou may change the user of the chown command to yourself of a newly created one for ipfs (here ubuntu as an example). Install IPFS: This is where the fun begins, the installation of IPFS is quite straightforward. We use ipfs-update tool to install and update IPFS easily: 1234567cd ~/wget https://dist. ipfs. io/ipfs-update/v1. 5. 2/ipfs-update_v1. 5. 2_linux-amd64. tar. gztar xvfz ipfs-update_v1. 5. 2_linux-amd64. tar. gzcd ipfs-updatesudo . /install. shipfs-update versionsipfs-update install latestRunning ipfs-update install latest will automatically install the latest release of IPFS or upgrade a previous installation like this: 12345678910$ sudo ipfs-update install v0. 4. 22fetching go-ipfs version v0. 4. 22binary downloaded, verifying. . . success! tests all passed. stashing old binaryinstalling new binary to /usr/local/bin/ipfschecking if repo migration is needed. . . Installation complete!Remember to restart your daemon before continuingNow we have to initialize IPFS Server with ipfs init --profile server (making sure IPFS_PATH is properly set) to generate the repo and its configuration file. We will have to edit that configuration file to turn the install into a proper IPFS Server. You can already check the content of that configuration file in $IPFS_PATH/ipfs/config IPFS Service setup: We can now automate the IPFS daemon management with Systemd or supervisord Create the following systemd to persist the lunch of IPFS Server across reboots: 123456789101112131415sudo bash -c 'cat &gt;/lib/systemd/system/ipfs. service &lt;&lt;EOL[Unit]Description=IPFS DaemonAfter=network. target[Service]ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ipfs daemonUser=ubuntuRestart=alwaysLimitNOFILE=10240Environment= IPFS_PATH=/mnt/disks/ipfs-disk/ipfs [Install]WantedBy=multi-user. targetEOL'We can now enable that service to start upon reboots: 123$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload$ sudo systemctl enable ipfs$ sudo systemctl start ipfsIPFS Gateway setup: Configure CORS on IPFS 12ipfs config --json API.

We can now restart the IPFS service to apply the changes: sudo systemctl restart ipfs Test: Test connectivity and CORS: 1234curl -v -H  Origin: http://&lt;wrong or right domains&gt;  \-H  Access-Control-Request-Method: POST  \-H  Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-Requested-With  \http://0. 0. 0. 0:5001/api/v0/swarm/peersYou can test the non/working reachability from different domains according to your CORS restrictions NGINX Proxy Setup: An NGINX installation as a proxy pass will enable us to store data with POST methods to https://&lt;your ipfs domain&gt;/api/v0/add and fetch them with GET method tohttps://&lt;your ipfs domain&gt;/ipfs First let’s install nginx. on Debian Based distributions: 123sudo apt updatesudo apt install -y nginxsudo systemctl status nginxInstall Certbot: By following the instructions on the Certbot site: (https://certbot. eff. org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuxenial-nginx. html)[https://certbot. eff. org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuxenial-nginx. html] This will have our nginx configuration file ready for us to add the final touches. The end result should be a NGINX config file with location sections:  /api/v0/add For adding files (pinning is on by default).  /ipfs To fetch content on the network.  / To deny all other traffic. 400: Invalid requestWe can now restart the nginx server: sudo systemctl restart nginx Hardening: We strongly recommend enabling unattended upgrades on your server and monitor the size of your IPFS Volume. You may have to grow it in size depending on your usage. Final notes: Private IPFS Network are an interestging way to answer the scalability of the IPFS network as described by the folks at Pinata. Stacktical will soon provide a service that will measure the uptime of each IPFS gateways and return the best endpoints to you. Reach out to us if you want to be part of it! That’s it! We went through tht process of installing a IPFS Gateway to store and deliver content securely on the IPFS Nerwork! We hope this guide will help other project who are using IPFS.

    "body": "2019/08/23 - Stacktical secures the DSLA. eth ENS domain nameToday the Stacktical team has been successfully granted the 4 characters DSLA. eth short domain name after a review conducted by the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Team conducted during the official ENS Short Name Reservation Process. Our team is glad to own ` DSLA. eth` and is looking forward to enriching the experience of the Stacktical community and the capabilities of the Stacktical Platform with cryptography-verified URLs and web proterties that everybody can trust . About the Ethereum Name Service (ENS): ENS is the domain name system that is built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain Network. As you might know, Internet is made of protocols that allow individuals to access online ressource using IP addresses,like 165. 42. 13. 37. The purpose of a domain name system is to replace such sequence of numbers with something that is easier to read, remember and use, like stacktical. com. In that spirit, the Ethereum Name Service eliminates the need to read, remember and use 42 characters long addresses, like 0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe, to access decentralized resources, send cryptocurrencies and interact with DApps. You can already expect ` DSLA. eth` to provide effortless access to our token smart contract. ENS addresses are already supported by multiple mobile and desktop cryptocurrency wallets, and some online services like popular cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. Time for a better, safer, fairer Web: ENS is not just the name service for Ethereum, it is an important piece of the Web 3. 0 infrastructure that paves the way to a better, more decentralized Internet.  ENS offers a secure &amp; decentralised way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names. Nick Johnson and the rest of the ENS Team are continuously improving the ENS service, allowing domains to be transfered easily as tokens and be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. We’re always excited for their new developements, such as the recently introduced ability to handle Tor . onion addresses.

    "body": "2019/07/30 -  Stacktical and XYO announce their partnership to empower the future of the travel industry and reinvent travel experiences using their respective technologies. PARIS, FRANCE — Stacktical, a Blockchain Platform for managing Service Level Agreements (SLA), and XYO, the first Geospatial Blockchain Network, are joining forces to introduce Geospatial Decentralized Service Level Agreements to the travel industry and superchage the operations of airline companies, airports and more travel service providers. With over 20 million luggages lost by airlines last year, and a record number of flight delays costing nearly 30 billion dollars to travel stakeholders, the travel industry is in urgent need for new governance approaches and technology solutions to remain sustainable. By joining forces, Stacktical and XYO can align airline and airport logistics capabilities with the risk that consumers are willing to bear, and ultimately alleviate the frustration of travelers upon delays and other service failures. This partnership is also a unique opportunity for Stacktical to explore how combining an open network of service level agreements and cryptocurrency incentives can increase the efficiency of existing consumer laws, such as the European Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004, that entitles travelers to compensation following flight delays. About XYO Network (XYO): XYO is a network of devices that anonymously collect and validate geospatial data, such as the location of an e-commerce package or the humidity of the world’s most remote places.  About Stacktical (DSLA): Powered by the DSLA token, Stacktical is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) platform for documenting, bargaining and tracking service commitments between service providers, employees and customers. Decentralized SLAs align the interests of service stakeholders by creating an open network of highly automated agreements that can boost employee morale and settle customer disputes using DSLA token service credits.

We have no exact date to share at this stage, but according to official information we have received from our account manager, the DSLA token will still be listed in a matter of days. Don’t do DSLA deposits to the exchange yet: Yesterday, members in our community noticed that the DSLA deposit feature had mistakenly been made available to all users on the exchange, despite any official announcement from P2PB2B and Stacktical. Please refrain from doing any DSLA deposit until further notice, you might lose your assets. In reality, the DSLA token smart contract integration was, and is still undergoing live testing before getting approved for effective listing, and the DSLA deposit featured should have never been available to users, other than P2PB2B developers. The postponement of the DSLA listing is the result of integration issues, raised by the aforementioned live testing session. While the development team achieved a certain degree of successful integration of DSLA, they expressed the will to fix these issues before listing us, rather than potentially undermining the community’s DSLA trading experience on d-day. While we undertand your frustration, we believe that P2PB2B team’s approach to handling the issue is in the true spirit of reliability engineering, and we appreciate their commitment to maintaining a good quality of service for their exchange, even if it means exposing the Stacktical team and our community to some downtime. It’s in our DNA to approach these situations cool-headed, since Stacktical has been created to help service providers align their reliability engineering and customer service capabilities with the risk that customers are willing to bear. Turning a bad situation into an opportunity: We would like to take this unfortunate opportunity to announce that, along with listing of the DSLA token on the P2PB2B exchange, Stacktical is also proud to partner with P2PB2B to help them track their quality of service, boost employee morale and compensate customers for service level violations, in a highly automated way. We will make sure to share the ins and outs of our partnership in a dedicated post. Ultimately, this bad customer experience is a foundational step to a future where uptime, deposit, withdrawal and other exchange commitments, are backed with Stacktical’s Decentralized Service Level Agreements and the DSLA token. It does help to have a taste of your own medecine. "

    "title": "DSLA Vesting Schedule",
    "body": "2019/06/26 - Vesting Schedule: The distribution of the DSLA tokens to token sale contributors follows a specific calendar called a vesting schedule.  A token vesting process is a common process in which a number of tokens are secured and locked away by a company for a certain period of time. It helps to prevent market price manipulations and protect the stability of the token over time.   Initial allocation per token sale contributor type: Private sale contributor: This type of contributor has obtained 25% of their total purchase, at the moment of purchase. Pre sale contributor: This type of contributor has obtained 50% of their total purchase, at the moment of purchase. Public sale contributor: This type of contributor has obtained 75% of their total purchase, at the moment of purchase. Agreement for future token allocation: According to our token sale smart contract and other signed agreements, a token sale contributor is authorized to claim 25% more DSLA from her total DSLA purchase, every 3 months, since January 1st 2018. Here is the corresponding vesting table:            At Purchase    March 31st    June 30th    September 30th         Private sale contributor   25%   50%   75%   100%       Pre sale contributor   50%   75%   100%           Public sale contributor   75%   100%           How to claim (expert users): To claim your tokens, expert user can directly call the public claimTokens() function from the wallet used to contribute to the DSLA token sale. 1234567891011  /**   * @dev Allows the sender to claim the tokens he is allowed to withdraw   */  function claimTokens() public {    require(getWithdrawableAmount(msg. sender) != 0);    uint256 amount = getWithdrawableAmount(msg. sender);    withdrawn[msg. sender] = withdrawn[msg. sender]. add(amount);    _deliverTokens(msg. sender, amount);  }Please see our token sale contract repository for reference. How to claim (all users): 1/ Go to https://stacktical. com: Note: Make sure that the address in your browser in https://stacktical. com before proceeding!Note: All DSLA tokens issued during the token sale are claimable, by now. You will need the MetaMask browser extension to claim your DSLA tokens. Please install it if it’s not done already, then connect to the main Ethereum network using the same account you have used during the DSLA token sale. 2/ Scroll down the homepage, all the way to the footer: The “CLAIM DSLA TOKENS” link is located in the “SERVICE” section of our official website footer. 3/ Click on the “CLAIM DSLA TOKENS” link in the footer: If you are authorized to claim DSLA tokens with the selected MetaMask account, click “CLAIM NOW” to withdraw your DSLA. If you are not authorized to claim DSLA tokens, the “NOTHING TO CLAIM!” message will be displayed instead. Congratulations!See you at launch. Possible issues ::  The website footer keeps displaying “NOTHING TO CLAIM!” but I haven’t claimed all my DSLA tokens yet…Make sure your MetaMask is connected to the same account you have used during the DSLA token sale.  I’m using an hardware wallet, and the transactions seems to be stuck and/or my MetaMask is buggy…Make sure your close your hardware wallet management software (e. g. Ledger Live) and retry.  The “Claim Tokens” transaction has been confirmed in MetaMask, but my DSLA balance isn’t updated…Make sure you have imported the right DSLA token in your MetaMask. Instructions here! For anything else, please reach out to admins in our official Telegram group "

    "body": "2019/06/25 - My name is route: On June 24th, Verizon accidently started routing Internet traffic through a small company in Nothern Pennsylvania for nearly three hours, causing a major outage of Cloudflare, Facebook, Amazon and other online service providers, including customers of the three aforementioned technology companies (including Discord). According to Cloudflare’s incident report, although they repeatedly called and emailed their support, the Cloudflare Ops team still had not hear from Verizon at the time of writing, over 8 hours after the incident. Nobody was aware of Verizon taking action to resolve the issue.  At Cloudflare, we wish that events like this never take place, but unfortunately the current state of the Internet does very little to prevent incidents such as this one from occurring. Fortunately, routing security technologies like RPKI and Decentralized Security SLAs powered by Stacktical could bring new ways to mitigate these risks in the future.
