    "title": "The Year 2019 in Review",
    "body": "2020/01/15 - Happy New Year to the Stacktical Community !: What better way to start 2020, than reflecting on last year’s achievements, and setting ever bigger goals for ourselves? Thank you for sticking with us through our crazy journey, and best of wishes for this new decade.  10. We crossed 1000 DSLA holders: More than 1000 early adopters acquired DSLA tokens in 2019. It has been an important milestone for Stacktical, considering that service level agreements are relatively unknown to the general public. As expected, the technical and business expertise required to assess the potential of decentralized service level agreements and cryptocurrency service credits, has limited the adoption of the DSLA token. But it has also forced us to review our copy, and better articulate our vision for the future. By focusing DSLA Network on rolling out service level agreements between proof-of-stake validators and delegators, we are expecting to grow our DSLA holders tenfold this year.  9. A new, updated vision is born: From the project inception, we have always defined Stacktical as a Platform: a combination of service management products working together. But last year, we realised that we were in fact building a true Protocol: a set of rules governing the exchange of data and value between stakeholders. This means :  DSLA Token is the currency of the DSLA Protocol DSLA Network, our flagship product, is the 1st implementation of the DSLA Protocol Other teams could implement DSLA Protocol to build their own SLA-based experiences2020 will be the perfect opportunity to introduce our plans, regarding the latter point.  8. DSLA has been listed on its 1st exchange: You need DSLA tokens to roll out, upgrade and enforce service level agreements on DSLA Network, or use DSLA Protocol in your own implementations. Listing DSLA on its 1st exchange has provided a simple, initial way of acquiring DSLA tokens, in preparation for the Q2 2020 launch of the Protocol mainnet. As per our roadmap, more listings are to be expected in 2020. We strongly advise you stay tuned on Telegram for announcements.  7. DSLA has been listed on coin trackers: In 2019 and following its listing on a cryptocurrency exchange, DSLA made its first appearance on coin discovery services such as CoinGecko or CryptoCompare.       Coin Tracker    Link         CoinGecko   Here       Coin Codex   Here       Coinpaprika   Here       CryptoCompare   Here       Nomics   Here   Getting listed on CoinMarketCap, the leading coin tracker, will require additional exchange listings, and consistent trading activity. This will be a core area of focus for the year ahead and we will make sure update the community once we meet these requirements.  6. We released a new website: During Summer 2019, our co-founders felt the urge to challenge the Product and Technology story that we want like to tell with the Stacktical Platform. A gazillion drawings, discussions and aha moments later, we introduced a new website that better articulates what the DSLA Protocol, the DSLA Token and the DSLA Network initiatives helps us fulfill our mission as a Service Governance company. Visit the new Stacktical Website 5. We won an innovation award: In November 2019, Stacktical has received an Overseas Innovation Prize, during the 2019 edition of the Innovation Outremer competition at STATION F, the world’s biggest startup campus. We would like to renew our thanks to Daniel Hierso, his team at Outremer Network, Orange, and all the partners that made this recognition possible. We’re humbled by your trust in our vision for the future of service governance, and we’re dedicated to making it a reality.  4. We released the DSLA Protocol β: DSLA is an autonomous service level agreement protocol built for service providers, to offer provable service level guarantees to customers, better adapt to changing service level needs, and effortlessly mitigate the economic impact of bad service levels. As a protocol, its purpose is to be implemented into various products using a Software Development Kit (SDK). DSLA Network, our flagship product, is the first decentralized application to implement DSLA Protocol to solve the specific problem of cascade slashing for Proof-of-Stake network participants.  3. We released the DSLA Network β: In 2019, more than 25% of Blockchain networks used the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) security model instead of (Bitcoin’s) Proof-of-Work (PoW). Sign of the new decade to come? In a Proof-of-Stake network, transactions are validated and securely added to the blockchain by network participants called Validators. Any network participant can become a Validator, by making a cryptocurrency security deposit called a Stake. Stakes entitle Validators to timely Block Rewards, in exchange for securing the network.  If other participants want to help secure the network without becoming Validators, they can delegate their Stake to the Validators of their choice, and earn a fraction of the Block Reward in return. The problem is that Validators that fail to meet the reliability requirements of a Proof-of-Stake network expose themselves and their Delegators to financial penalties.  This is known as the slashing risk. Powered by DSLA Protocol, DSLA Network is a decentralized web application to protect Tezos Nominators and PoS Delegators against losing their cryptocurrency stake, when their Tezos Bakers and PoS Validators miss blocks, or misbehave on the network. Staking on DSLA Network enables Tezos Nominators and PoS Delegators to enrol in slashing compensation programs. DSLA Protocol will automatically compensate program enrolees upon missed blocks and slashing events, and will automatically reward program owners, to:  Incentivize Quality of Service over time; Increase their self-bonding capacity; Accept more Tezos Nominators and Pos Delegators. 🏆 Win-Win ! Read the deck 2. We won a grant from a top blockchain foundation: We have received a Research &amp; Development grant from one of the most respectables blockchain foundations in the industry, to work on three open source products aiming at improving the experience of their Proof-of-Stake network participants, and the experience of their blockchain researchers. These products will pave the way to more decentralization and more interoperability in the DSLA architecture, especially when it comes to monitoring onchain block validation metrics, to enforce block agreements between PoS Validators and Delegators. We will make sure to share more details about the grant and the full scope of the project, in a dedicated article, as soon as we’re properly authorized to disclose this initiative.  1. We partnered with companies we admire: In 2019, we have interviewed hundreds of incredible service providers, in order to fine-tune our understanding of their SLA management needs. This focused effort has been instrumental in validating and dismissing the product assumptions we had made until then, and getting to the bottom of what the DSLA Network should be about, from the perspective of true DevOps professionals. Today, we have onboarded several new providers with our revamped approach, and are very excited to work with them over the course of the year 2020. If you’re a validator interested in protecting your delegators against slashing, feel free to email us at contact@stacktical. com, to explore partnership opportunities.  "

    "body": "2019/12/16 - When new exchange ?: As an early stage business-to-business initiative, with a legitimate use of blockchain and decentralized ledger technologies, the Stacktical Platform has definitely room for adoption. And we’re well aware that we have a lot to learn to achieve our goals as a company. 6 months after our initial appearance on the P2PB2B cryptocurrency exchange, the trading activity of the DSLA token have yet to meet the expectations of our community stakeholders. While this first listing put our company on the cryptocurrency map, and was undoubtedly an important step in the right direction, DSLA needs to be more liquid to fulfill its mission as the utility token of the DSLA Protocol, and empower reward, compensation and staking scenarios on the Platform. Thankfully, and with the help of our community, we have been exploring several new listing opportunities with this liquidity objective in mind. The result of this effort is a series of regulatory-compliant DSLA listing milestones, that closely follow the development maturity of the collection of smart contracts empowering Stacktical.

But our end goal is to list DSLA on a major exchange when, and only when, the Stacktical Platform is ready to demonstrate its full potential.

Real DSLA tokens       Release   DSLA Protocol smart contracts are publicly available on the mainnet, without limitation.    Real DSLA tokens   At maximum Network Maturity, real DSLA tokens are used by the protocol to empower production applications. While we originally planned for a major listing in December, there is simply too much blood in the streets, and too little fundamentals, to support this decision at this time. With an intermediary listing and increased liquidity, DSLA will also have a greater chance to meet CoinMarketCap’s listing requirements, and dramatically expand the global reach of the Stacktical project. The DSLA token is currently being tracked by the following websites:       Coin Tracker    Link         (NEW) CoinGecko   Here       (NEW) Coin Codex   Here       (NEW) Coinpaprika   Here       (NEW) CryptoCompare   Here       (NEW) Nomics   Here   "

DeFi introduces the ability for anyone to roll-out traditional financial products (e. g. loans), and reap their benefits (e. g. interests) on a decentralized network like the Ethereum blockchain. Lately, we’ve been experimenting on adding DeFi capabilities to SLAs, to address some of the design challenges that comes with decentralized service governance. The illiquid nature of SLA compensation pool, for example. These experiments turned out to be a great way to improve how we’re breaking down the Stacktical Platform into products, and exactly what product should represent our project. Originally, we planned on positionning the DSLA Network application as our flagship product. But it led the community into believe that we were simply developing a decentralized application, while we were in fact building a fully-fledged governance protocol. In the Stacktical Platform architecture, a collection of smart contracts support the DSLA Network application behind the scenes. To put our blockchain development at the forefront, we’ve decided to officialize the DSLA protocol as our core component.  DSLA Protocol is the simplest expression of what we’re really doing: building an autonomous governance protocol for developers like ourselves, willing to roll-out, bargain and enforce service level agreements at scale. Along with empowering the DSLA Network application, we can’t wait to see how SaaS and other applications can leverage the DSLA Protocol to supercharge their SLA contracting and reliability engineering practices.

    "body": "2019/09/21 - The definite guide to your high-performance IPFS GatewaySo you want to store and fetch your public IPFS Assets with no compromise of speed and reliability while participating in strengthening the network? You are at the right place!We compiled the essential bits so you can get this done quickly. What’s IPFS?The Interplanetary File System is exactly what the name says, a distributed file system to replace the centralized HTTP Web that we know. This is how Stacktical’s IPFS server is used to our own platform’s Dapp (15s faster add operations for a lightweight JSON payload vs Infura’s). We limited the domain that accesses our node with CORS and used an Nginx encrypted proxy to handle HTTPS connections to IPFS. Turnkey solutions like Infura’s IPFS Gateway and Pinata are great to start and to give IPFS a try but everyone should avoid Centralized Services to access decentralized services (which defeat the purpose of Decentralization and don’t provide the performance and reliability you need for your (D)app. This article will cover:  The complete setup of a Cloud instance to run our IPFS node How to make your node securely available for your (D)appIPFS Server setup: We are leveraging Google Cloud Platform so this article will cover setup on a compute instance type n1-standard-1 with Debian OS but it’s pretty much straightforward on other Cloud vendors and Linux Oses. Here we create an instance with HTTP and HTTPS allowed in the firewall section (We will have an HTTP -&gt; HTTPS redirect).  Or with the GCP SDK: gcloud compute --project=stacktical-0 instances create ipfs-node-1 --zone=us-central1-b --machine-type=n1-standard-1 --image-project=debian-cloud --boot-disk-size=10GB --boot-disk-type=pd-standard --tags=http-server,https-server Storage layer: Our Node Storage need will most likely grow in size, so it’s better to give our node a dedicated Volume for flexibility and extra persistency: Add a persistent disk to your IPFS Node instance and mount it. That’s how our node fstab entry looked like: UUID=[DISK_UUID] /mnt/disks/[MNT_DIR] ext4 discard,defaults,nofail 0 2 Where:  [DISK_UUID] is the Disk Unique Id obtained with the blkid command.  [MNT_DIR] is the directory where the ipfs volume will be mounted, /mnt/disk/ipfs-disk/ in our case. Set the Volume location for IPFS to make use of it: 1234echo 'export IPFS_PATH=/mnt/disk/ipfs-disk/ipfs' &gt;&gt;~/. bash_profilesource ~/. bash_profilesudo chown -R ubuntu:ubuntu $IPFS_PATH/*mkdir $IPFS_PATH/ipfsYou may change the user of the chown command to yourself of a newly created one for ipfs (here ubuntu as an example). Install IPFS: This is where the fun begins, the installation of IPFS is quite straightforward. We use ipfs-update tool to install and update IPFS easily: 1234567cd ~/wget https://dist. ipfs. io/ipfs-update/v1. 5. 2/ipfs-update_v1. 5. 2_linux-amd64. tar. gztar xvfz ipfs-update_v1. 5. 2_linux-amd64. tar. gzcd ipfs-updatesudo . /install. shipfs-update versionsipfs-update install latestRunning ipfs-update install latest will automatically install the latest release of IPFS or upgrade a previous installation like this: 12345678910$ sudo ipfs-update install v0. 4. 22fetching go-ipfs version v0. 4. 22binary downloaded, verifying. . . success! tests all passed. stashing old binaryinstalling new binary to /usr/local/bin/ipfschecking if repo migration is needed. . . Installation complete!Remember to restart your daemon before continuingNow we have to initialize IPFS Server with ipfs init --profile server (making sure IPFS_PATH is properly set) to generate the repo and its configuration file. We will have to edit that configuration file to turn the install into a proper IPFS Server. You can already check the content of that configuration file in $IPFS_PATH/ipfs/config IPFS Service setup: We can now automate the IPFS daemon management with Systemd or supervisord Create the following systemd to persist the lunch of IPFS Server across reboots: 123456789101112131415sudo bash -c 'cat &gt;/lib/systemd/system/ipfs. service &lt;&lt;EOL[Unit]Description=IPFS DaemonAfter=network. target[Service]ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/ipfs daemonUser=ubuntuRestart=alwaysLimitNOFILE=10240Environment= IPFS_PATH=/mnt/disks/ipfs-disk/ipfs [Install]WantedBy=multi-user. targetEOL'We can now enable that service to start upon reboots: 123$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload$ sudo systemctl enable ipfs$ sudo systemctl start ipfsIPFS Gateway setup: Configure CORS on IPFS 12ipfs config --json API. HTTPHeaders. Access-Control-Allow-Origin '[ &lt;your domain or all (*)&gt; ]'ipfs config --json API. HTTPHeaders.

We can now restart the IPFS service to apply the changes: sudo systemctl restart ipfs Test: Test connectivity and CORS: 1234curl -v -H  Origin: http://&lt;wrong or right domains&gt;  \-H  Access-Control-Request-Method: POST  \-H  Access-Control-Request-Headers: X-Requested-With  \http://0. 0. 0. 0:5001/api/v0/swarm/peersYou can test the non/working reachability from different domains according to your CORS restrictions NGINX Proxy Setup: An NGINX installation as a proxy pass will enable us to store data with POST methods to https://&lt;your ipfs domain&gt;/api/v0/add and fetch them with GET method tohttps://&lt;your ipfs domain&gt;/ipfs First let’s install nginx. on Debian Based distributions: 123sudo apt updatesudo apt install -y nginxsudo systemctl status nginxInstall Certbot: By following the instructions on the Certbot site: (https://certbot. eff. org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuxenial-nginx. html)[https://certbot. eff. org/lets-encrypt/ubuntuxenial-nginx. html] This will have our nginx configuration file ready for us to add the final touches. The end result should be a NGINX config file with location sections:  /api/v0/add For adding files (pinning is on by default).  /ipfs To fetch content on the network.  / To deny all other traffic. &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;html&gt;

    "body": "2019/08/23 - Stacktical secures the DSLA. eth ENS domain nameToday the Stacktical team has been successfully granted the 4 characters DSLA. eth short domain name after a review conducted by the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Team conducted during the official ENS Short Name Reservation Process. Our team is glad to own ` DSLA. eth` and is looking forward to enriching the experience of the Stacktical community and the capabilities of the Stacktical Platform with cryptography-verified URLs and web proterties that everybody can trust . About the Ethereum Name Service (ENS): ENS is the domain name system that is built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain Network. As you might know, Internet is made of protocols that allow individuals to access online ressource using IP addresses,like 165. 42. 13. 37. The purpose of a domain name system is to replace such sequence of numbers with something that is easier to read, remember and use, like stacktical. com. In that spirit, the Ethereum Name Service eliminates the need to read, remember and use 42 characters long addresses, like 0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe, to access decentralized resources, send cryptocurrencies and interact with DApps. You can already expect ` DSLA. eth` to provide effortless access to our token smart contract. ENS addresses are already supported by multiple mobile and desktop cryptocurrency wallets, and some online services like popular cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. Time for a better, safer, fairer Web: ENS is not just the name service for Ethereum, it is an important piece of the Web 3. 0 infrastructure that paves the way to a better, more decentralized Internet.  ENS offers a secure &amp; decentralised way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names. Nick Johnson and the rest of the ENS Team are continuously improving the ENS service, allowing domains to be transfered easily as tokens and be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. We’re always excited for their new developements, such as the recently introduced ability to handle Tor . onion addresses. "

    "body": "2019/07/30 -  Stacktical and XYO announce their partnership to empower the future of the travel industry and reinvent travel experiences using their respective technologies. PARIS, FRANCE — Stacktical, a Blockchain Platform for managing Service Level Agreements (SLA), and XYO, the first Geospatial Blockchain Network, are joining forces to introduce Geospatial Decentralized Service Level Agreements to the travel industry and superchage the operations of airline companies, airports and more travel service providers. With over 20 million luggages lost by airlines last year, and a record number of flight delays costing nearly 30 billion dollars to travel stakeholders, the travel industry is in urgent need for new governance approaches and technology solutions to remain sustainable. By joining forces, Stacktical and XYO can align airline and airport logistics capabilities with the risk that consumers are willing to bear, and ultimately alleviate the frustration of travelers upon delays and other service failures. This partnership is also a unique opportunity for Stacktical to explore how combining an open network of service level agreements and cryptocurrency incentives can increase the efficiency of existing consumer laws, such as the European Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004, that entitles travelers to compensation following flight delays. About XYO Network (XYO): XYO is a network of devices that anonymously collect and validate geospatial data, such as the location of an e-commerce package or the humidity of the world’s most remote places.  About Stacktical (DSLA): Powered by the DSLA token, Stacktical is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) platform for documenting, bargaining and tracking service commitments between service providers, employees and customers. Decentralized SLAs align the interests of service stakeholders by creating an open network of highly automated agreements that can boost employee morale and settle customer disputes using DSLA token service credits.

    "title": "DSLA Listing (Slightly) Delayed",
    "body": "2019/07/24 - No new listing date yet, but a matter of days: Originally scheduled for July 25th, 2019, we regret to inform you that the DSLA token listing has been posponed, due to unforeseen circumstances with DSLA deposits and withdrawals on the P2PB2B exchange. We have no exact date to share at this stage, but according to official information we have received from our account manager, the DSLA token will still be listed in a matter of days. Don’t do DSLA deposits to the exchange yet: Yesterday, members in our community noticed that the DSLA deposit feature had mistakenly been made available to all users on the exchange, despite any official announcement from P2PB2B and Stacktical. Please refrain from doing any DSLA deposit until further notice, you might lose your assets. In reality, the DSLA token smart contract integration was, and is still undergoing live testing before getting approved for effective listing, and the DSLA deposit featured should have never been available to users, other than P2PB2B developers. The postponement of the DSLA listing is the result of integration issues, raised by the aforementioned live testing session. While the development team achieved a certain degree of successful integration of DSLA, they expressed the will to fix these issues before listing us, rather than potentially undermining the community’s DSLA trading experience on d-day. While we undertand your frustration, we believe that P2PB2B team’s approach to handling the issue is in the true spirit of reliability engineering, and we appreciate their commitment to maintaining a good quality of service for their exchange, even if it means exposing the Stacktical team and our community to some downtime. It’s in our DNA to approach these situations cool-headed, since Stacktical has been created to help service providers align their reliability engineering and customer service capabilities with the risk that customers are willing to bear. Turning a bad situation into an opportunity: We would like to take this unfortunate opportunity to announce that, along with listing of the DSLA token on the P2PB2B exchange, Stacktical is also proud to partner with P2PB2B to help them track their quality of service, boost employee morale and compensate customers for service level violations, in a highly automated way. We will make sure to share the ins and outs of our partnership in a dedicated post. Ultimately, this bad customer experience is a foundational step to a future where uptime, deposit, withdrawal and other exchange commitments, are backed with Stacktical’s Decentralized Service Level Agreements and the DSLA token. It does help to have a taste of your own medecine. "

    "title": "DSLA Vesting Schedule",
    "body": "2019/06/26 - Vesting Schedule: The distribution of the DSLA tokens to token sale contributors follows a specific calendar called a vesting schedule.  A token vesting process is a common process in which a number of tokens are secured and locked away by a company for a certain period of time. It helps to prevent market price manipulations and protect the stability of the token over time.   Initial allocation per token sale contributor type: Private sale contributor: This type of contributor has obtained 25% of their total purchase, at the moment of purchase. Pre sale contributor: This type of contributor has obtained 50% of their total purchase, at the moment of purchase. Public sale contributor: This type of contributor has obtained 75% of their total purchase, at the moment of purchase. Agreement for future token allocation: According to our token sale smart contract and other signed agreements, a token sale contributor is authorized to claim 25% more DSLA from her total DSLA purchase, every 3 months, since January 1st 2018. Here is the corresponding vesting table:            At Purchase    March 31st    June 30th    September 30th         Private sale contributor   25%   50%   75%   100%       Pre sale contributor   50%   75%   100%           Public sale contributor   75%   100%           How to claim (expert users): To claim your tokens, expert user can directly call the public claimTokens() function from the wallet used to contribute to the DSLA token sale. 1234567891011  /**   * @dev Allows the sender to claim the tokens he is allowed to withdraw   */  function claimTokens() public {    require(getWithdrawableAmount(msg. sender) != 0);    uint256 amount = getWithdrawableAmount(msg. sender);    withdrawn[msg. sender] = withdrawn[msg. sender]. add(amount);    _deliverTokens(msg. sender, amount);  }Please see our token sale contract repository for reference. How to claim (all users): 1/ Go to https://stacktical. com: Note: Make sure that the address in your browser in https://stacktical. com before proceeding!Note: All DSLA tokens issued during the token sale are claimable, by now. You will need the MetaMask browser extension to claim your DSLA tokens. Please install it if it’s not done already, then connect to the main Ethereum network using the same account you have used during the DSLA token sale. 2/ Scroll down the homepage, all the way to the footer: The “CLAIM DSLA TOKENS” link is located in the “SERVICE” section of our official website footer. 3/ Click on the “CLAIM DSLA TOKENS” link in the footer: If you are authorized to claim DSLA tokens with the selected MetaMask account, click “CLAIM NOW” to withdraw your DSLA. If you are not authorized to claim DSLA tokens, the “NOTHING TO CLAIM!” message will be displayed instead. Congratulations!See you at launch. Possible issues ::  The website footer keeps displaying “NOTHING TO CLAIM!” but I haven’t claimed all my DSLA tokens yet…Make sure your MetaMask is connected to the same account you have used during the DSLA token sale.  I’m using an hardware wallet, and the transactions seems to be stuck and/or my MetaMask is buggy…Make sure your close your hardware wallet management software (e. g. Ledger Live) and retry.  The “Claim Tokens” transaction has been confirmed in MetaMask, but my DSLA balance isn’t updated…Make sure you have imported the right DSLA token in your MetaMask. Instructions here! For anything else, please reach out to admins in our official Telegram group "

    "body": "2019/06/25 - My name is route: On June 24th, Verizon accidently started routing Internet traffic through a small company in Nothern Pennsylvania for nearly three hours, causing a major outage of Cloudflare, Facebook, Amazon and other online service providers, including customers of the three aforementioned technology companies (including Discord). According to Cloudflare’s incident report, although they repeatedly called and emailed their support, the Cloudflare Ops team still had not hear from Verizon at the time of writing, over 8 hours after the incident. Nobody was aware of Verizon taking action to resolve the issue.  At Cloudflare, we wish that events like this never take place, but unfortunately the current state of the Internet does very little to prevent incidents such as this one from occurring. Fortunately, routing security technologies like RPKI and Decentralized Security SLAs powered by Stacktical could bring new ways to mitigate these risks in the future.
