Powered by the DSLA token, Stacktical is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) platform for documenting, bargaining and tracking service commitments between service providers, their partners and their customers.

It enables service providers to drive customer acquisition and retention by transparently committing to a baseline quality of service, and automatically executing remediation scenarios, such as delay and downtime compensations, when agreed service levels are not met.
