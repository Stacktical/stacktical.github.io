DSLA Protocol is a turnkey, peer-to-peer risk management infrastructure for developers and their communities, that empowers anyone to manage their exposure to the performance failures of application, network and service, using peer-to-peer service level agreements.

DSLA Protocol's flagship use case is to optimize your staking rewards, by enabling you to hedge against the bad performance of your staking services.
