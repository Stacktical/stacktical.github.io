## From V1 to L1

The DSLA core team is proud to announce the development of our own blockchain network, **DSLA Chain**, powered by Avalanche's [subnet technology](https://docs.avax.network/subnets). 

DSLA Chain will host a comprehensive suite of Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) products, in an effort to achieve consumer protection **beyond DSLA Protocol**.

‚ú® DSLA Protocol remains our flagship product‚Äî**v3.0** will first launch on DSLA Chain.

‚õΩÔ∏è DSLA ERC20 tokens will serve as the **gas tokens** of DSLA Chain.

üó≥ DSLA ERC721 / 1155 tokens will serve as the **governance tokens** of DSLA Chain.

üåê DSLA Protocol v2.0 and the [dsla.network](https://dsla.network) application **will remain multi-chain**.



### V1.0

DSLA Protocol v1.0 was introduced in Q2 2021, as a **proof-of-concept for a Third-Party Risk Management solution** hosted on a blockchain network.

Historically, consumer protection has been lagging behind consumers exposure to third-party risk.

DSLA Protocol v1.0 was engineered to bridge this gap, by enabling anyone to develop any consumer protection they deem necessary.

We call such protection a **D**ecentralized **S**ervice **L**evel Agreement‚Äîthat is what DSLA stands for.



### V2.0

DSLA Protocol v2.0 is a **community-driven improvement over v1.0**, introduced in Q4 2022. 

It frames the Decentralized Service Level Agreement as a **money-back guarantee** that you can add to any commercial transactions.

A more compelling value proposition.



#### Solving Consumer Protection

In software terms, DSLA Protocol is a **middleware**. 

It connects peers to third-party analytics through a Decentralized Service Level Agreement that can issue, collect and transfer cryptocurrency.

Each Decentralized Service Level Agreement promises to lock third-party analytics to a fixed performance goal, for a fixed period.

Hit or Miss? Peers can vote for the outcome of the periodic verification of a Decentralized Service Level Agreement.

They must stake a collateral, to register their vote. The bigger the stake, the more a peer offsets the risk of hitting or missing a fixed performance goal.

Opposite votes effectively enables **the transfer of third-party risk between peers**.

### Why a blockchain network?

DSLA Protocol has been delivering consumer peace of mind **with a focus on last mile logistics: remedies**.

But in order to **address all functions of Third-Party Risk Management** without limitations, our community needs more than electronic contracts. 

DSLA Chain is a physically, logically and politically isolated blockchain network, that aims at better meeting the requirements of the data, processes and stakeholders of Third-Party Risk Management.

With the network-level capabilities of DSLA Chain, and its resilience to externalities, our community can bring about a paradigm shift in consumer protection, while mastering the Quality of Service delivered to DSLA Chain network participants.



### Launch Stack

On top of being a Proof-of-Stake blockchain network, the DSLA Chain experience relies on 6 protocols, all pioneers in their respective product category:

* **Monitor by DSLA**

A client-side monitoring protocol that enables on-chain, third-party performance analytics.

* **Disclose by DSLA**

An open standard for third-party risk disclosure.

* **Teach by DSLA**

A virtual classroom protocol on third-party risk management.

* **Vault by DSLA**

A parametric escrowing protocol.

* **Publish by DSLA**

A content management protocol based on markdown

* **DSLA Protocol v3.0**

A protocol for adding peer-to-peer, **money-back guarantees** to any third-party transactions.

* **Resolve by DSLA**

An incident response protocol that orchestrates repairs across stakeholders.



‚ÑπÔ∏è Product names are temporary.
