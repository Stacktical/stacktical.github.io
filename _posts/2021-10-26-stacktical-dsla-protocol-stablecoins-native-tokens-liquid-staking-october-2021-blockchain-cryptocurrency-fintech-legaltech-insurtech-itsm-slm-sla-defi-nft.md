## Additional Token Support Sets the Stage for Scaling

October was a busy month, and the DSLA Protocol core team deployed some key upgrades that are worth celebrating. Support was added to allow for DSLA contract liquidity pools to be funded with multiple different tokens, making the protocol much more flexible. Now you can fund a DSLA contract liquidity pool with the DSLA token or any of the following tokens:

1. **Stablecoins**
   * DAI
   * USDC
   * USDT
2. **Wrapped Versions of Native Tokens**
   * AVAX
   * BNB
   * ETH
   * FTM
   * ONE
   * MATIC
3. **Liquid Staking Tokens**
   * stETH ([https://lido.fi](https://lido.fi))

## Why This is Huge

### It was Needed to Scale

Exclusively using DSLA tokens to create the DSLA contract liquidity pools was a bottleneck for growth and adoption in a couple of ways.

*First*, to fully provide coverage for the **value at risk** in our flagship staking use case, more capital is needed that can be provided by DSLA tokens alone. The DPoS staking market has a multi-billion dollar TVL, with anywhere from 10% to 30% of that considered as **value at risk**. DSLA Protocol's total market cap is quite small relative to the value the protocol is looking to provide protection for, so it makes sense that other forms of liquidity are needed.

*Second*, as additional use cases are developed and onboarded to the protocol, the amount of capital required to cover the **value at risk** across all use cases will increase exponentially. Now with support for stablecoins, native tokens and liquid staking tokens, DSLA Protocol is capable of supporting liquidity requirements for the almost unlimited use cases that the protocol can service. 

*Third*, some users and providers may want or need to limit their exposure to the price volatility of the DSLA token. Stablecoins, native tokens and liquid staking tokens all provide options to allow users of the protocol to change or eliminate their exposure to price volatility.

> A major bottleneck to scaling has been removed with the integration of stablecoins, native tokens and liquid staking for DSLA contract liquidity pools.

Ready to scale.âœ…

### Intuitive Risk, Rewards and Liquidity

Now that DSLA contract liquidity, rewards and compensation can be quantified in terms of either stablecoins or the native currency of each respective chain, it makes understanding the rewards, compensation, risk and benefit much easier for end users. Speaking in terms of these other currencies can be much more intuitive for users and removes the friction of needing to do an additional set of calculations.

### Liquid Staking - Supporting Advanced DeFi

Liquid staking is one of the most exciting developments in DeFi and staking, allowing for users to unlock the value of their staked assets.  By integrating support for liquid staking tokens, DSLA Protocol opens up support for a massive pool of capital.

### Future Support for Additional Tokens

Integration of stablecoins, native tokens and liquid staking tokens paves the way for future integrations of other tokens. With the groundwork already laid, future integrations of standard tokens will be fairly straightforward. This could come into play, for example, when a DeFi protocol wants to integrate DSLA Protocol, but wants to offer compensation pools in their own token.
