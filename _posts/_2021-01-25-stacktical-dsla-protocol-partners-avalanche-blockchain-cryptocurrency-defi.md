## DSLA Protocol for Avalanche

DSLA Protocol enables anyone to add a service level agreement on top of any third-party service, to reduce customers exposure to infrastructure risks and incentivise the connectivity, performance and availability of services, networks and applications over time.

To bring our developer community access to more technologies, we are proud to announce that we have partnered with Ava Labs, to launch DSLA Maxima "Avalanche Edition", a maximalist port of DSLA Protocol on the Avalanche blockchain network.

## Staking SLAs...

Our immediate collaboration will focus on adding support for **$AVAX Staking Agreements** to the [DSLA.network](http://dsla.network) flagship application. 

$AVAX Staking Agreements compensate $AVAX delegators for drops in $AVAX staking rewards, while rewarding $AVAX staking pool operators for their ability to endorse and validate Avalanche blocks, and mining DSLA rewards for liquidity providers.

Soon after, DSLA Protocol will be deployed as smart contracts on the Avalanche network, serving the same purpose, but with built-in interoperability and scalability that are unique to Avalanche, hence the "Maxima" codename.

## ...And more

In the long term, the DSLA core development team will enable developers to add high-throughput, risk management and parametric insurance capabilities to their application built on Avalanche.

"As the Ethereum blockchain network increasingly struggles to satisfy the engineering requirements of developers, and is failing to bank the unbanked because of unsustainable fees, our team is convinced that an EVM-compatible blockchain like Avalanche has the potential to become a new, more scalable home for DeFi and the next generation of Solidity-based decentralized applications." said Wilhem Pujar, CEO at Stacktical and DSLA Protocol core developer.

## About DSLA Protocol
![DSLA Protocol, Oasis Edition](/assets/img/dsla-network_square-hand-shot-social_avalanche.png)

As users outsource increasingly more functions of their lives and businesses to third-party service providers, they need better ways to manage their exposure to third-party infrastructure risk. Especially when money is at stake.

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that gives anyone the ability to create, monitor and execute decentralized service level agreements and parametric insurance policies.

When the monitored performance of a service is within the thresholds of an agreement, third-party service providers and liquidity providers earn the right to claim a reward from the agreement liquidity pool. Conversely, when an agreement is violated, customers earn the right to claim a compensation. 

Win-Win.
