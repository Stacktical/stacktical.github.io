## Welcome Champions! 🗺️

Building on our [DSLA Metaverse Prologue post](https://blog.stacktical.com/metaverse/nft/2022/03/01/stacktical-dsla-protocol-metaverse-inaugural-nft-mint-blockchain-cryptocurrency-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-itsm-slm-sla-defi-nft.html), let's dive a little deeper into the vision for the DSLA Metaverse + The Academy, and what to expect with the MVP.

The goal of the DSLA Metaverse is to have an onboarding tool that helps teach anyone how to use DSLA Protocol to manage risk and reward engagement for putting that knowledge to work.

In other words **Learn 2 Earn**.

The Academy is located in the Quicksand Dips biome, and that is where our Champions will start their journey...

## Quicksand Dips and The Academy 🏰

Quicksand Dips will be the first biome that is available in the DSLA Metaverse MVP; where our Champions will learn and use DSLA Protocol to battle the risk of volatility of Digital Asset Floor Prices.

Launching with an initial track of straightforward courses, Champions will learn how to use DSLA Protocol and the DSLA.network dApp to battle the volatility of Digital Asset Floors. Champions will be able to choose a path that teaches them how to battle risk as a digital asset holder looking for protection or as a digital asset creator/backer providing protection. In DSLA jargon these paths are that of the User or the Provider.

As a Champion completes courses and tasks, actions taken will be verifiable on the blockchain, entitling the Champion to mint the corresponding Knowledge NFT once minting is live!

Use that knowledge consistently and actively to earn the right to mint Skill NFTs!

## Engagement and the Leaderboard 🏅

Lore NFTs will be awarded based on protocol usage, the more active our Champions are the better their chances of qualifying for a Lore NFT. Activity and engagement will be measured using a combination of snapshots and on-chain metrics, starting with the launch of the DSLA Metaverse.

A leaderboard will be deployed on DSLA.network soon and the top 10 leaders every month will qualify for a Lore NFT.

Lore NFTs are desirable as they offer protocol incentives (ie. increased staking rewards!).

## Minting Soon! 🔮

Minting will be rolling out after the initial MVP, but engagement and activity will be measured starting at launch. Once minting is live, Champions will be able to mint NFTs earned based on their activity since launch.

The Academy and metaverse will be modular, and expandable, with other biomes and features coming online after the initial launch and as DSLA Protocol scales out. We look forward to community feedback to help guide as we build out and improve DSLA Metaverse and The Academy.
