## Earn rewards for protecting DOT staking deposits against staking risks

Dear DSLA Champions, our team is proud to announce that we are adding support for the Polkadot network to the DSLA Protocol! Polkadot relies on a Nominated Proof of Stake (NPoS) system, where nominators back validators with their own stake as a show of faith in the good behavior of the validator. 

During the upcoming DSLA Incentivized Beta, DSLA contracts will provide DOT token nominators with a decentralized hedge against slashing, staking efficiency drops and late reward payouts, while enabling anyone to earn rewards for protecting DOT staking deposits against staking risks.

> This will allow DSLA to enable Polkadot validators to become provably trustworthy validators, even if they lack the track record and brand recognition to convince nominators to back them.  

Note that, although we share common goals with the Polkadot team, we are not official Polkadot partners. Polkadot hasn't officially endorsed the DSLA incentivized beta.

That being said, adding DOT staking insurance to the DSLA protocol is in line with the scope of our Polkadot W3F grant, and the work initiated on Parachain scalability and service level management since February 2020.

You can expect more news related to the Polkadot ecosystem in the coming weeks, as we're finishing up developments and solidify the final scope of the DSLA architecture.

## About the DSLA Incentivized Beta Test  

On September 30th 2020, DSLA core developers are organizing an incentivized beta to validate the functional, performance, reliability and security assumptions of the [DSLA.network ](https://dsla.network) decentralized application that integrates DSLA Protocol, before tentatively launching both products on the mainnet on November 30th 2020. Beta participants will be rewarded using beta bDSLA tokens that they will be converted to real, mainnet DSLA tokens upon launch.

To follow the news about the DSLA Incentivized Beta, feel free to subscribe to the projectâ€™s dedicated [Product Hunt page](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dsla-network), and join the ongoing conversation [on Telegram](https://t.me/stacktical). 

The DSLA core development team will share more information about the beta roadmap very soon.

## About our Polkadot W3F Grant

Polkadot is a blockchain network that provides shared security and secure messaging to Parachains, plug-and-play specialized blockchain, with parallelizable computations. Its architecture is a departure from generalized programmable blockchain that empower a wide variety of use cases at the expense of scalability.

Fundamental scalability bottlenecks remain in Polkadot, though. 

The fact that there will be a finite number of Parachains on the network upon launch is proof that limitations exist: While the capacity boost in using parallel Parachain computation is substantial, ensuring that they remain up, synced, and secure does cost resources.

As a Polkadot researcher, part of your job is to figure out these resource requirements and drive architectural decisions (e.g. allocating a specific number Parachain slots) through repeated performance benchmarks, in various protocol configuration and transactional scenarios.

But rather than spending weeks running thousands of performance benchmarks, and manually interpret their result, what if you could let your machine could figure out the scalability of your system itself using mathematical models, and very few performance measurements?

That is exactly what we set out to do with [willitscale-polkadot](https://github.com/Stacktical/willitscale-polkadot).
