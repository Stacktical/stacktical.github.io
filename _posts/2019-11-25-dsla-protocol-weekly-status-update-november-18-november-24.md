* **The new Stacktical website has been released.**

The Stacktical website is the home of the Stacktical company, and the gateway to the different components of the Stacktical Platform.Â 

As such, it is our responsibility to make sure it conveys clear corporate and product information to our private contributors, our developer and cryptocurrency community, our customers and an increasingly diverse crowd of project stakeholders.

In order to be aligned enough with the evolving direction of the Stacktical project, we put the Stacktical Website developments on hold during Summer, and focused on challenging the Product and Technology story that we want like to tell. 

A gazillion drawings, discussions and aha moments later, it is time to re-introduce DSLA to the world, and our new website definitely does set the tone for greater things moving forward.

* **Re-introducing DSLA to the World**

Have you heard about DeFi, short for **De**centralized **Fi**nance?  

DeFi introduces the ability for anyone to roll-out traditional financial products (e.g. loans), and reap their benefits (e.g. interests) on a decentralized network like the Ethereum blockchain.

Lately, we've been experimenting on adding DeFi capabilities to SLAs, to address some of the design challenges that comes with decentralized service governance. The illiquid nature of SLA compensation pool, for example.

These experiments turned out to be a great way to improve how we're breaking down the Stacktical Platform into products, and exactly what product should represent our project.

Originally, we planned on positionning the **[DSLA Network application](https://dsla.network)** as our flagship product. But it led the community into believe that we were simply developing a decentralized application, while we were in fact building a fully-fledged governance protocol. 

In the Stacktical Platform architecture, a collection of smart contracts support the DSLA Network application behind the scenes. To put our blockchain development at the forefront, we've decided to officialize the DSLA protocol as our core component. 

![DSLA by Stacktical: An Autonomous SLA Protocol for the Web 3.0](https://storage.googleapis.com/stacktical-public/stacktical_introducing-dsla-protocol.png)

**DSLA Protocol** is the simplest expression of what we're really doing: building an autonomous governance protocol for developers like ourselves, willing to roll-out, bargain and enforce service level agreements at scale.

Along with empowering the **[DSLA Network application](https://dsla.network)**, we can't wait to see how SaaS and other applications can leverage the DSLA Protocol to supercharge their SLA contracting and reliability engineering practices.

More information a dedicated series of post here, soon.  
For now, please join the developer discussion **[on Telegram](https://t.me/stacktical)**, if you haven't already.
