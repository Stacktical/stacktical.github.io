## ⚙️ Validators, Validators, Validators

Dear members of the DSLA community, we are excited to announce that a **Validation Launchpad for Avalanche Subnets** will join the DSLA family of products in 2022! 🎉 

Avalanche is a network of networks, allowing anyone to create their own blockchain, called subnet. But for these subnets to be secure, their blocks need to be verified and endorsed by as many Avalanche validators as possible.

Thanks to DSLA Protocol's decentralized service level agreements, subnet operators will be able to incentivise the validation of their subnets, while holding Avalanche validators accountable for their performance, using performance challenges.

Think "**Incentivised Testnet as a Service**".

## 🗓 DSLA in 2022

2022 will mark the consolidation of the value proposition of SLAs for the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Metaverse Finance (MetaFi) sectors, as well as our first notable foray into real world, third-party risk management use cases.
