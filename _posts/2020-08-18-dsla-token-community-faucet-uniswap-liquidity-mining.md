## When Liquidity? DSLA.finance is LIVE

Dear champions, we have been thinking for a while about how we could enable everyone in the community to contribute more actively to the DSLA family of products. One of our key objectives as the DSLA Core Team is to ensure that users ultimately have a greater say about DSLA Protocol and its DApps, than us.  

DSLA needs to fulfil its mission through the power of network participation and open source contribution. Through **your power**.

As we hinted over the past few week, we have been experimenting a new Community Program called the **DSLA Residency**, designed to empower you to shape the future of the project using Github (mostly). 

Today, we are proud to announce that one of the first contributions to the Program is ready for primetime, and that the DSLA Residency is entering the final phase of its private Pilot, before we start publicy onboarding new Residents.

## Meet the DSLA Community Faucet

Borrowed from Ampleforth's Geyser DApp, the DSLA Community Faucet is **a smart faucet that rewards users in DSLA tokens, for providing liquidity on [the official DSLA-ETH pair on Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/pair/0xd0fbb87e47da9987d345dbdf3a34d4266cf5ebe9)**. 

The more DSLA liquidity you provide on Uniswap, and for longer, the greater share of the faucet pool you receive.

### Made in Residency

One of our DSLA Resident Developer thought this DeFi solution would be a perfect answer to the "When liquidity?" question the community has been (repeatedly) asking for the past two weeks. With the growing interest for what we're building, it is indeed a very relevant question to ask. 

Familiar with farming and liquidity mining techniques, he suggested, studied, and shipped a solution that is now hosted at **[DSLA.finance](https://dsla.finance)**, and that is already improving the liquidity and trading conditions on Uniswap (since the faucet news leaked earlier today üòÖ).

For his tremendous contribution, the DSLA Resident Developer has been rewarded with 4,206,900 DSLA from the Community Reserve, that is used to handle all liquidity matters, including but not limited to facilitating trades on available DSLA markets while increasing its circulating supply.

For the time being, we plan on allocating a total of 100M DSLA to operate the full Residency Program. Our team is looking forward to confirming the exact allocation soon, and sharing more information about the Program's official launch.

For now, please **[hit the deck](https://storage.googleapis.com/stacktical-public/STACKTICAL_DSLA-RESIDENCY.pdf)**, for a quick overview of what the Residency is about.

### Important Security Considerations

* The faucet works with a new, unmodified deployment of the **open source Solidity contract of Ampleforth's Geyser**, fully audited by CertiK **[in this report](https://github.com/ampleforth/ampleforth-audits/tree/master/token-geyser)**.

* The DSLA Community Faucet smart contract is deployed **[at this address](https://etherscan.io/address/0x167d7b02ac5db5e0166417e162fc91d4ba8683be#code)**, while Ampleforth's Geyser can **[found here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0eEf70ab0638A763acb5178Dd3C62E49767fd940#code)**.  If you compare the two contracts with a **[difference checking tool like this one](https://www.diffchecker.com/SiUG6Het)**, you will be quickly able to assess with certainty that **they are identical**.

* The DApp at **[https://dsla.finance](https://dsla.finance)**, connected to our own Geyser deployment has been reverse engineered from Ampleforth's Geyser DApp. Our DSLA Resident thought it was faster to rely on an existing UI rather that developing an original one. We tend to agree.

* Even though we took all the necessary steps to ensure that what our Resident has shipped works as intended, **please exercise extra caution when using the Community Faucet**, whether you're interacting through the DApp or directly interact with the smart contract itself. Always double check the address of the smart contract you are interacting with on MetaMask.

* Make sure you read Ampleforth's Geyser [documentation](https://www.ampleforth.org/geyser/) to know how things work. Our very own is coming soon.

### Faucet Token Release Schedule

The DSLA Community Faucet has initially been filled with **15M DSLA, rewarded over 15 days**.  

Before the faucet expires on **September 1st, 2020**, and if it is deemed useful (and has the statistics to prove it), we will proceed with adding a more sizeable contribution to the Community Faucet pool, and further accompany the growth of liquidity on Uniswap for the rest of the year.

**Time to ü¶Ñ‚õè  !**

## About DSLA Protocol

![DSLA Protocol](https://storage.googleapis.com/stacktical-public/dsla-protocol_by_stacktical.png) 

DSLA Protocol is a decentralized alternative to SLA contracts. It enables anyone to vouch for the reliability of a service, earn rewards when the service performs as expected, and claim financial compensation when the service doesn‚Äôt meet expectations. 

DSLA Protocol will debut an incentivized beta on the Ethereum testnet in Q3 2020, and will initially focus on providing a hedge against staking risks, and unfulfilled reliability promises in the DeFi and Open Finance industries.
