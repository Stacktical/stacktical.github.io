## 💡 Feature Spotlight

*EDIT 2020/10/29: Previous Items #2 and #3 of Phase II have moved to Phase III.*

### #1 Ability to withdraw bDSLA stakes

Delegators, Validators and their Vouchers will be able to withdraw the bDSLA tokens they staked to DSLA Contracts, minus the rewards and compensations they might have paid at the end of Phase I.

### #2 Better tracking of stakes

During Phase I it was not easy to keep track of the agreements you staked to.

The `MY AGREEMENTS` section only displays created DSLA Contracts, which somehow helped Validators keep track of the liquidity they added to their own contracts. But as a a Delegator, you had no direct access to your active hedges.

Accordingly, we will:

* Open up the `HEDGE`section to keep track of active hedges against staking risks as a Delegator;  

* Open up the `POOL` section to keep track of active compensation pool deposits;  

* Display both active hedges and active compensation pool deposits in the `MY AGREEMENTS` section.

DSLA is a risk management protocol for developers, to build applications and operate infrastructures that are natively capable of financially protecting users against failures. 

It enables anyone to vouch for the reliability of a service, get paid when the service performs as expected, or get compensated when the service does not meet expectations.
