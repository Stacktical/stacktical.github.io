## üí° Feature Spotlight

There are many changes expected with the **[DSLA.network √êapp](https://dsla.network)** during Phase II.

### #1 Ability to withdraw bDSLA stakes

Delegators, Validators and their Vouchers will be able to withdraw the bDSLA tokens they staked to DSLA Contracts, minus the rewards and compensations they might have paid at the end of Phase I.


### #2 Ability to claim bDSLA compensations / rewards

25+ DSLA Contracts have been created during the Phase I of the DSLA incentivized beta, and verified at the start of Phase II. But bDSLA staking rewards are yet to be distributed to Delegators, Validators and their Vouchers.

Based on the measured Harmony (ONE) Staking Efficiency of our partner, the P-OPS Validator, bDSLA rewards and compensations will become self-claimable by DSLA Contract stakeholders during Phase II:

* **A Delegator** will be able to claim 99.7% of her initial stake if her agreement is breached (0.3% claiming fees);  

* **A Validator** will be able to claim 19.94% of their Delegators stake if her agreement is honoured (0.3% claiming fees);  

* **A Voucher** will be able to claim 15.95% of Delegators stake if her agreement is honoured (0.3% claiming fees + 20% commission to the Validator she vouches for).

### #3 Instant token burn of claiming fees

For every claim at the end of a Phase, the DSLA Protocol will charge and burn 0.3% claiming fee to Delegators, Validators and Vouchers. All tokens burned by the DSLA Protocol during DSLA claims are removed from circulation forever.

### #4 Better tracking of stakes

During Phase I it was not easy to keep track of the agreements you staked to.

The `MY AGREEMENTS` section only displays created DSLA Contracts, which somehow helped Validators keep track of the liquidity they added to their own contracts. But as a a Delegator, you had no direct access to your active hedges.

Accordingly, we will:

* Open up the `HEDGE`section to keep track of active hedges against staking risks as a Delegator;  

* Open up the `POOL` section to keep track of active compensation pool deposits;  

* Display both active hedges and active compensation pool deposits in the `MY AGREEMENTS` section.
