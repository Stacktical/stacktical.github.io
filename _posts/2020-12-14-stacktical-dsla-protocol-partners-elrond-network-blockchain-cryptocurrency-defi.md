## DSLA x Elrond

Dear community, [Stacktical](https://stacktical.com/), the core development team of the DSLA Protocol, is proud to announce that we have partnered with the [Elrond](https://chain.link/) network to launch DSLA Maxima "Elrond Edition", a maximalist port of DSLA Protocol on the Elrond blockchain.

The first DSLA product helps validators and delegators on Proof of Stake networks reduce their mutual exposure to staking infrastructure risks, using decentralized service level agreements and two-way, self-settled compensation claims.

Our immediate collaboration will focus on adding Elrond Network validators information in the DSLA Ethereum-based smart contracts. Soon after, DSLA Protocol will be deployed as smart contracts on the Elrond Network, serving the same purpose but at higher speeds and lower costs, hence the "Maxima" codename.

In the long term, the DSLA core development team will leverage Elrond’s high throughput and inexpensive smart contracts execution platform to deploy a decentralized SLA framework suitable for digital services of any kind.

“Elrond has one of the largest validator networks in the PoS space and is a great addition to DSLA Protocol, and our flagship two-way hedge against staking and delegation risks. But the biggest value for us long term is its high throughput and inexpensive smart contracts execution capabilities, which we can leverage to settle SLAs in real-time, at internet-scale, for a wide variety of industries.” said Wilhem Pujar, Stacktical CEO.

The collaboration will bring additional adoption for the Elrond smart contract platform and provide an immediately useful tool for Staking Providers looking to increase the quality of their services.

“Today’s unexpected Google outage will likely cause tens of millions of dollars in losses to businesses worldwide. Automatically settling SLA breaches will increase the quality of online services and help avoid such situations. We’re happy to support this through our collaboration with Stacktical” said Beniamin Mincu, Elrond CEO.

## About Elrond

Elrond is the internet-scale blockchain, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 6-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.

DSLA is a risk management protocol for developers, to build applications and operate infrastructures that are natively capable of financially protecting users against failures.

It enables anyone to vouch for the reliability of a service, get paid when the service performs as expected, or get compensated when the service does not meet expectations.
