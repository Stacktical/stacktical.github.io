## DSLA Protocol for Elrond

DSLA Protocol enables anyone to add a service level agreement on top of any third-party service, to reduce customers exposure to infrastructure risks and incentivise the connectivity, performance and availability of networks and applications. 

To bring our developer community access to more technologies, we are proud to announce that we have partnered with [Elrond](https://elrond.com/) to launch DSLA Maxima "Elrond Edition", a maximalist port of DSLA Protocol on the Elrond blockchain network.

## Staking SLAs...

Our immediate collaboration will focus on adding **$eGLD Staking Agreements** to the DSLA.network flagship application. 

$eGLD Staking Agreements compensate $eGLD delegators for drops in $eGLD staking rewards, while rewarding $eGLD staking pool operators for their ability to endorse and validate Elrond Network blocks, and mining DSLA rewards for liquidity providers.

Soon after, DSLA Protocol will be deployed as smart contracts on the Elrond Network, serving the same purpose, but at higher speeds and lower costs, hence the "Maxima" codename.

## ...And more

In the long term, the DSLA core development team will enable developers to add high-throughput, risk management and parametric insurance capabilities to their application built on Elrond.

“Elrond has one of the largest validator networks in the PoS space and is a great addition to DSLA Protocol, and our flagship two-way hedge against staking and delegation risks. But the biggest value for us long term is its high throughput and inexpensive smart contracts execution capabilities, which we can leverage to settle SLAs in real-time, at internet-scale, for a wide variety of industries.” said Wilhem Pujar, CEO at Stacktical and DSLA Protocol core developer.

The collaboration will bring additional adoption for the Elrond smart contract platform and provide an immediately useful tool for Staking Providers looking to increase the quality of their services.

“Today’s unexpected Google outage will likely cause tens of millions of dollars in losses to businesses worldwide. Automatically settling SLA breaches will increase the quality of online services and help avoid such situations. We’re happy to support this through our collaboration with Stacktical” said Beniamin Mincu, CEO at Elrond.

## About Elrond

Elrond is the internet-scale blockchain, designed from scratch to bring a 1000-fold cumulative improvement in throughput and execution speed. To achieve this, Elrond introduces two key innovations: a novel Adaptive State Sharding mechanism, and a Secure Proof of Stake (PoS) algorithm, enabling linear scalability with a fast, efficient, and secure consensus mechanism. Thus, Elrond can process upwards of 15,000 transactions per second (TPS), with 6-second latency, and negligible cost, attempting to become the backbone of a permissionless, borderless, globally accessible internet economy.

## About DSLA Protocol
![DSLA Protocol, Elrond Edition](/assets/img/dsla-network_square-hand-shot-social_elrond.png)

As users outsource increasingly more functions of their lives and businesses to third-party service providers, they need better ways to manage their exposure to third-party infrastructure risk. Especially when money is at stake.

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that gives anyone the ability to create, monitor and execute decentralized service level agreements and parametric insurance policies.

When the monitored performance of a service is within the thresholds of an agreement, third-party service providers and liquidity providers earn the right to claim a reward from the agreement liquidity pool. Conversely, when an agreement is violated, customers earn the right to claim a compensation. 

Win-Win.
