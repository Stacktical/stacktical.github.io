## DSLA Protocol joins the BitForex CApp Town

Members of the cryptocurrency community sure like to talk about (the lack of) marketing activities... But marketing isn't just about communication: the success of DSLA as a blockchain project will **first and foremost depend on our ability to develop a strong distribution network for the products that we're building** (something that you learn as a 2nd time entrepreneur).  

Initiated by leading cryptocurrency exchange BitForex, **[CApp Town](https://www.bitforex.com/en/capptown)** is an up and coming service for discovering cryptocurrency and blockchain applications like DSLA Protocol and the family of DSLA products.

We are honoured to become one of the selected projects to be showcased on CApp Town, and are excited to further develop the awareness of DSLA, as we're getting closer to our highly anticipated mainnet launch. You can definitely expect DSLA to be available on increasingly more discovery platforms, moving forward.

## About DSLA Protocol

[DSLA Protocol](https://stacktical.com) is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

DSLA Protocol's flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of Proof-of-Stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the connectivity, performance and availability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers.
