## About DSLA Protocol

![DSLA Protocol](https://storage.googleapis.com/stacktical-public/dsla-protocol_by_stacktical.png) 

DSLA Protocol is a decentralized alternative to SLA contracts. It enables anyone to vouch for the reliability of a service, earn rewards when the service performs as expected, and claim financial compensation when the service doesn‚Äôt meet expectations. 

Currently available in public beta at [https://dsla.network](https://dsla.network), DSLA Protocol will debut on the mainnet in Q4 2020, and will initially focus on securing staking rewards against slashing penalties, and unfulfilled reliability promises in the DeFi and Open Finance industries.
