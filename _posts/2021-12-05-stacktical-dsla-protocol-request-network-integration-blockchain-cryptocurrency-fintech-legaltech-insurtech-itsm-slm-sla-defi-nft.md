## Request + Pay using DSLA on request.network üí±

[Request](https://request.network), an innovative and industry leading payment request network, has added native support for the DSLA token!

Individuals and organizations can now request and send payments denominated in DSLA using the [Request apps](https://request.network/en/community/built-with-request/).

### üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What is Request? 

[Request](https://request.network) is an industry leading open network for payment requests. It provides an easy and affordable way to issue invoices and receive payments using cryptocurrencies (trust us, we use it!). In addition it enables easy tracking for compliance purposes which can be onerous when dealing with cryptocurrencies.

The [Request apps](https://request.network/en/community/built-with-request/) provide users great flexibility, allowing for invoices to be denominated in fiat currencies or one of over 25 cryptocurrencies. With [Request](https://request.network), all involved parties are also able to use the same data as a unified "source of truth." Data access is permissioned, so that it is only accessible to those who need it, and immutable as a result of the underlying blockchain technology.

Support on [Request](https://request.network) provides an interesting additional utility for the DSLA token, in addition to helping the core team streamline operations. We also have some ideas on other ways DSLA protocol can apply some risk management principles for payment flows, so stay tuned on that end!
