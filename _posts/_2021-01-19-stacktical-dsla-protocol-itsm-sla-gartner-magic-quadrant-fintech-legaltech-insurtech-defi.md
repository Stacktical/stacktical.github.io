## Bigger than us



## IT Service Management (ITSM)

As per Gartner, one of the most famous research and advisory firms in the technology industry, ITSM tools "facilitate the tasks and workflows associated with the management and delivery of quality IT services".

It goes without saying that DSLA Protocol strives to become such tool. But the problem with the Web 2.0 definition of ITSM, is that many tasks and workflows are great on paper, but do are painful in practice.

We've experienced it first hand with the Stacktical platform, our attempt at democratising predictive analytics for DevSecOps teams.

The DSLA utility token is the cryptocurrency counterpart of Cloud Service Credits, a technology that served historically as a way to gamify SLAs, and give managers actionable ways to connect DevSecOps accountability with customer satisfaction. 

DSLA Protocol, as both an ITSM and service governance tool, embraces some of the game theory principles of Cloud Computing companies—like compensating Cloud customers for downtimes using service credits—while bringing multiple new practices to service stakeholders.

## Decentralized Governance



## DSLA Buy Backs: Road to DAO

In its first year of operation, 50% of all fees captured while using different cryptocurrencies in DSLA contract liquidity pools on the Ethereum mainnet, will be swapped back to DSLA ERC20 utility tokens, and added to the DSLA Protocol's treasury. 

The buybacks will be transparently documented in a monthly report, and the funds auditable by our community. The DSLA Protocol Treasury will serve as a foundation for our upcoming governance efforts, an important topic we will make sure to articulate in a dedicated post soon.

## Conclusion

Our vision for the future is that every company in the world will be represented by its own cryptocurrency asset. It’s only natural to make sure that DSLA Protocol can support these assets, to pave the way to customer experience automation practices that are on par with existing branding and loyalty efforts of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS companies.

## About DSLA Protocol
![DSLA Protocol, Elrond Edition](/assets/img/dsla-network_square-hand-shot-social_elrond.png)

As users outsource increasingly more functions of their lives and businesses to third-party service providers, they need better ways to manage their exposure to third-party infrastructure risk. Especially when money is at stake.

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that gives anyone the ability to create, monitor and execute decentralized service level agreements and parametric insurance policies.

When the monitored performance of a service is within the thresholds of an agreement, third-party service providers and liquidity providers earn the right to claim a reward from the agreement liquidity pool. Conversely, when an agreement is violated, customers earn the right to claim a compensation. 

Win-Win.
