## Use DSLA to hedge against NFT market risks  

Dear DSLA champions and cryptocurrency community, the DSLA core development team is proud to announce that we are adding support for Non Fungible Tokens (NFTs), to DSLA Protocol! ðŸŽ‰

This important step of DSLA Protocol's development will empower OpenSea and other Creators around the world to incentivise the purchase of their NTFs, and top-up their royalties using **NFT Impermanent Loss Agreements**.

Our strong belief is that NFTs are the future of media ownership, as well as one of the greatest ways to showcase, trade and distribute creative works ever invented.

But without a risk management vehicle to reduce customers exposure to market risks, NFTs will struggle to fulfill their mission as one of the defining asset classes of our generation.

The DSLA core development team is very excited by the upcoming release, and we cannot wait to share more about our OpenSea integration and NFT strategy, in the near future.

## Introduction to Non Fungible Tokens (NFT)  

A non-fungible token or NFT, is a special type of cryptocurrency that represents an asset that cannot be replicated. Although Creators can create any amount of NFT copies, each copy will remain unique, indivisible and rare. 

This makes NFT an excellent fit for digital art, and collectibles in general.

## NFT and Risk: What is Impermanent Loss?  

Assuming you purchase NFT digital art and collectibles using ETH, NFT Impermanent Loss happens when the value of your NFT purchased in ETH, ends up being less than simply holding ETH.

In short, NFT Impermanent Loss is a byproduct of the volatility of ETH as a payment method.

## DSLA Protocol fixes this  

By making DSLA contracts, Creators enable their customers to hedge against the volatility of ETH, and the resulting NFT Impermanent Loss, for a set period of time.

When the monitored ETH and NFT prices stay within the thresholds of an agreement, Creators earn the right to claim a bonus from the agreement's liquidity pool.

Conversely, when an agreement is violated because of the Impermanent Loss of a NFT, Customers earn the right to claim a compensation from the agreement's liquidity pool. 

Once again, we're hoping to better balance interests between service providers and service users thanks to DSLA Protocol's unique ability to converge expectations, automate the execution of bonus-malus policies that incentivise both sides of the table, and build trust using upfront capital commitments.

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements and bonus-malus insurance policies.
