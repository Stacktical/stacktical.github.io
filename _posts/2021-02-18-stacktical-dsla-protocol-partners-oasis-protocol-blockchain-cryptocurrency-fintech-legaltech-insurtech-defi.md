## DSLA Protocol for Oasis

DSLA Protocol enables anyone to add a service level agreement on top of any third-party service, to reduce customers exposure to infrastructure risks and incentivise the connectivity, performance and availability of services, networks and applications over time.

To bring our developer community access to more technologies, we are proud to announce that we have partnered with Oasis Protocol, to launch DSLA Maxima "Oasis Edition", a maximalist port of DSLA Protocol to the Oasis blockchain network.

One of the major challenges faced by blockchain networks is to balance the need for transparency as a community, with the need for privacy as individuals and organisations. 

Oasis Protocol built a great ecosystem to achieve just that, and empower decentralized use cases that require more nuanced ways to handle sensitive data and information.

## Staking SLAs...

Our immediate collaboration will focus on adding support for **$ROSE Staking Agreements** to the [DSLA.network](http://dsla.network) flagship application. 

$ROSE Staking Agreements compensate $ROSE delegators for drops in $ROSE staking rewards, while rewarding $ROSE staking pool operators for their ability to endorse and validate Oasis Network blocks, and mining DSLA rewards for liquidity providers.

Soon after, DSLA Protocol will be deployed as smart contracts on the Oasis network, serving the same purpose, but with built-in privacy capabilities that are unique to Oasis, hence the "Maxima" codename.

## ... And more hedging products

In the long term, the DSLA core development team will enable developers to add privacy-enabled, risk management  and parametric insurance capabilities to their application built on Oasis.

"DSLA contracts on Oasis could enable organizations to reduce their exposure to cyber-security incidents, by incentivizing low triage response time with their third-party security service providers. I am also convinced that a privacy-first network infrastructure like Oasis has the potential to empower the next wave of DeFi and social applications." said Wilhem Pujar, CEO at Stacktical and DSLA Protocol core developer.

## About DSLA Protocol

![DSLA Protocol, Oasis Edition](/assets/img/dsla-network_square-hand-shot-social_oasis.png)

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements and bonus-malus insurance policies.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).
