## üé§ Partner Onboarding

Dear DSLA champions, after weeks of preparation and anticipation, the DSLA core team is proud to announce that we are finally getting started with the onboarding of partnering validators and their delegators to the DSLA incentivized beta test!

For the next 7 days, and until October 6 at 00:00 CET, we will closely assist ONE, BAND and DOT users with an active staking or delegation deposit, in acquiring mainnet DSLA tokens, and claim testnet bDSLA tokens to partake in the beta challenges during Phase I and beyond.

## üèÅ Community Onboarding

Along with the onboarding of our partners, we will enable DSLA champions to autonomously claim their testnet bDSLA tokens on October 6, directly from the **[stacktical.com](https://stacktical.com)** website.

Wilhem will allocate time to answer your questions about Phase 0 on the project's official Telegram group, so make sure you **[join the conversation](https://t.me/stacktical)** and feel free to ask, while making a conscious effort to stay on topic.

## üìï Universal Onboarding Guide

The official **[DSLA Incentivized Beta Guide](https://readme.stacktical.com/dsla-incentivized-beta/)** will be updated with universal onboarding instructions, once the bDSLA claiming feature is available to the general public on the **[stacktical.com](https://stacktical.com)** website, on October 6.
