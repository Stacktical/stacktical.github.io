> Stacktical and XYO announce their partnership to empower the future of the Travel Industry using their respective technologies.

PARIS, FRANCE — Stacktical, a Blockchain Platform for managing Service Level Agreements (SLA), and XYO, the first Geospatial Blockchain Network, are joining forces to introduce Geospatial Decentralized Service Level Agreements to airline companies, airports and the entire Travel Industry.

Last year, over 20 million luggages were declared lost by airlines, and a record number of flight delays were reported. In this context, it is mission-critical to empower travel service providers with effortless ways to track belongings and soothe inconvenienced travelers.

> **"Together, Stacktical and XYO can better align airport logistics capabilities with the risk that consumers are willing to bear, and ultimately alleviate the frustration of travelers upon delays and other service failures. Our partnership is also a unique opportunity to improve the existing Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004, that entitles travelers to compensation following flight delays"**, commented Wilhem Pujar, CEO and co-founder at Stacktical
