> Stacktical and XYO announce their partnership to empower the future of the travel industry and reinvent travel experiences using their respective technologies.

PARIS, FRANCE — Stacktical, a Blockchain Platform for managing Service Level Agreements (SLA), and XYO, the first Geospatial Blockchain Network, are joining forces to introduce Geospatial Decentralized Service Level Agreements to the travel industry and superchage the operations of airline companies, airports and more travel service providers.

With over 20 million luggages lost by airlines last year, and a record number of flight delays costing nearly 30 billion dollars to travel stakeholders, the travel industry is in urgent need for new governance approaches and technology solutions to remain sustainable. 

By joining forces, Stacktical and XYO can align airline and airport logistics capabilities with the risk that consumers are willing to bear, and ultimately alleviate the frustration of travelers upon delays and other service failures. 

This partnership is also a unique opportunity for Stacktical to explore how combining an open network of service level agreements and cryptocurrency incentives can increase the efficiency of existing consumer laws, such as the European *Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004*, that entitles travelers to compensation following flight delays.
