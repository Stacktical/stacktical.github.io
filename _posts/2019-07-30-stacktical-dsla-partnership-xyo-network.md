> Stacktical and XYO announce their partnership to empower the future of the travel industry and reinvent travel experiences using their respective technologies.

PARIS, FRANCE — Stacktical, a Blockchain Platform for managing Service Level Agreements (SLA), and XYO, the first Geospatial Blockchain Network, are joining forces to introduce Geospatial Decentralized Service Level Agreements to the travel industry and superchage the operations of airline companies, airports and more travel service providers.

With over 20 million luggages lost by airlines last year and a record number of flight delays, the travel industry is in dire need for new governance approaches and technology solutions. 

Together, Stacktical and XYO can better align airline and airport logistics capabilities with the risk that consumers are willing to bear, and ultimately alleviate the frustration of travelers upon delays and other service failures. 

We are very excited to explore a wide range of possibilities This partnership is also a unique opportunity to improve the existing Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004, that entitles travelers to compensation following flight delays.
