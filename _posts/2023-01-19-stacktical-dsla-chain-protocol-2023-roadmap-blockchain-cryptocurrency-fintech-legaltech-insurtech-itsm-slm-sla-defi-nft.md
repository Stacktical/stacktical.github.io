# Reading Market Demand

DSLA Protocol v2.0 was introduced in Q4 2022, roughly 18 months after DSLA Protocol v1.0‚Äîour original proof of concept for **a blockchain-based Third-Party Risk Management (TPRM) solution**.

This release is the latest snapshot of a continuous feedback loop between the stakeholders that extract value from Service Level Agreements (SLA), and the stakeholders that contribute to developments or go-to-market operations.

After crossing 2B DSLA in volume since launch, DSLA Protocol v2.0 is showing signs of product-market fit and succeeds in separating design assumptions from market-validated needs. Through the [dsla.network](https://dsla.network) application, it delivers an increasingly compelling Third-Party Risk Management experience.



## A Story of Expectations and Reality

DSLA Protocol is a middleware that **bridges the gap between customers expectations and the after-sales performance of goods, services and assets**. 

To fulfill its mission, it uses an electronic contract with monetary capabilities‚Äîthe Decentralised Service Level Agreement (DSLA)‚Äî**to codify policies that make customers whole again following third-party failures**-.

In practice, the Decentralised Service Level Agreement works like its own, single-purpose market that:

* Represents a performance risk using a synthetic asset, the Service Credit;
* Allows you to mint Service Credits, by staking a cryptocurrency premium;
* Indexes Service Credits on the performance of a good / service / asset;
* Allows you to convert your Service Credits back to your staked cryptocurrency.



**Service Credits accrue with your losses. So converting them effectively offset your returns.**



## The DSLA Risk Architecture (DRA)

At a fundamental level, DSLA Protocol offsets volatility, in any direction:

* The Volatility of **Returns**
* The Volatility of **Availability**
* The Volatility of **Digital Asset Floors**
* The Volatility of **Digital Currency Pegs**
* The Volatility of **Response Time**
* The Volatility of **Delivery Time**



**Our collective ability to read the market demand for identified risk classes is the single driving force behind our success in 2023.**
