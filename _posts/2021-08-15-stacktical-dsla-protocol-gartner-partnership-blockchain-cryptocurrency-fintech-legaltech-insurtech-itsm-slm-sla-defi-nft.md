## Welcoming the world leading research firm to the DSLA Protocol ecosystem

Dear community, the core development team of DSLA Protocol is pleased to announce that we have partnered with world leading research and advisory firm [**Gartner**](https://www.gartner.com/en/about), for the next major milestone of DSLA Protocol's growth: bringing third-party risk management to the masses with real-world, enterprise-grade use cases. ðŸŽ‰

Creators of the **legendary technology hype cycle**, Gartner is a trusted advisor and an objective resource for more than 14,000 enterprises in 100+ countries.

Through this partnership, DSLA Protocol will tap into Gartner's technology research teams, playbooks and network to fine-tune the strategy and value proposition of DSLA Protocol together, and onboard thousands of new developers and customers across all industries.

> More than 80% of legal and compliance leaders tell us that third-party risks were identified after initial onboarding and due diligence, suggesting traditional due diligence methods in risk management policy fail to capture new and evolving risks. - Gartner, Inc

## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Protocol](/assets/img/dsla-protocol_ecosystem.jpg)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dsla-protocol#markets**)

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables developers and infrastructure operators to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).
