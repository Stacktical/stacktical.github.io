# Stacktical secures the `DSLA.eth` ENS domain name

Today the Stacktical team has been successfully granted the 4 characters `DSLA.eth` short domain name after a review conducted by the Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Team conducted during the official ENS [Short Name Reservation Process](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/announcing-the-ens-3-6-character-eth-name-reservation-process-7f3cc4d13f65).

Our team is glad to own ` DSLA.eth` and is looking forward to enriching the experience of the Stacktical community and the capabilities of the [Stacktical Platform](https://dsla.network) with cryptography-verified URLs and web proterties that everybody can trust .

## About the Ethereum Name Service (ENS)

ENS is the domain name system that is built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain Network.  

As you might know, Internet is made of protocols that allow individuals to access online ressource using IP addresses,like `165.42.13.37`. The purpose of a domain name system is to replace such sequence of numbers with something that is easier to read, remember and use, like **[stacktical.com](https://stacktical.com)**.

In that spirit,  **the Ethereum Name Service eliminates the need to read, remember and use 42 characters long addresses**, like **[0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe](https://etherscan.io/token/0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe)**, to access decentralized resources, send cryptocurrencies and interact with DApps. 

You can already expect ` DSLA.eth` to provide effortless access to our token smart contract.
ENS addresses are already supported by multiple mobile and desktop cryptocurrency wallets, and some online services like popular cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex.

## Time for a better, safer, fairer Web

ENS is not just the name service for Ethereum, it is an important piece of the Web 3.0 infrastructure that paves the way to a better, more decentralized Internet.

> ENS offers a secure & decentralised way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names.

Nick Johnson and the rest of the ENS Team are continuously improving the ENS service, allowing domains to be transfered easily as tokens and be traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. We're always excited for their new developements, such as the [recently introduced ability to handle Tor .onion addresses](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/ens-now-supports-tor-onion-address-resolution-9bb3bdff6217).
