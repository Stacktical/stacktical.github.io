| ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER          |
|:---------------------------|
| Generally speaking, any risk swaps involving interest rates, monetary rates or yields are regulated by the [SEC](https://www.sec.gov) and [CFTC](https://www.cftc.gov/) under the [Dodd-Frank Act](https://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/index.htm). This post discusses, **for educational purposes only**, how a proof of concept built using DSLA could provide a superior alternative to some existing products such as a CDS. |

## Legacy Market, Legacy Solution

Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are a part of a multi-trillion dollar market that operates mainly Over The Counter (OTC), due to the fact that such **swaps** are often tailored to specific client needs and not necessarily easy to standardize. Existing CDS products also do not generally address many of the DeFi risks that crypto ecosystem participants are exposed to.

A blockchain-based solution powered by DSLA, could provide a superior alternative to the legacy OTC markets, while making CDS' more flexible and accessible. Using DSLA would increase transparency and effeciency while reducing systemic risk.

### What is a CDS?

A CDS is a financial agreement to swap risk between two counterparties. The seller of the CDS agrees to compensate the buyer for an defined value in the event of a debt default or similar credit event where a debtor is unable to honor the terms of a transaction. The buyer of the CDS receives this protection in exchange for fees paid at predetermined intervals (ie. quarterly or monthly).

With DSLA, the seller of a CDS would be a Liquidity Provider, underwriting the risk of a debt default or credit event. The buyer of a CDS would be a User, depositing a Premium to receive protection in event of a debt default.

### A Risk-Agnostic Subordinated Risk Swap Engine

If a risk can be measured, then it can be tokenized and swapped using DSLA. With this in mind, you can basically think of DSLA as a risk-agnostic Subordinated Risk Swap engine that uses third-party performance analytics to determine the status and outcome of swap agreements.

CDS', specifically ones geared towards the largely unaddressed DeFi market, are one example of a risk that could be swapped using this engine. However, the possibilities are virtually limitless; any risk that can be measured can be tokenized and then swapped.

While it would also be possible to support other types of classic **risk swaps**, these products are generally regulated, as noted in the disclaimer, and there would need to be significant regulatory groundwork laid to do so.

## How DSLA Could Improve the Legacy Solution

### Peer-to-Peer Agreements

All DSLA agreements are peer-to-peer, eliminating the need for the intermediaries that are required in the OTC market. Removing intermediaries increases efficiency and allows more market participation.

### Increased Transparency

Transparency is a natural by-product of being a blockchain-based solution. Live data on active swaps could be accessed at any time, by anyone simply by reading publicly available data on the blockchain. This level of transparency and liveness is vastly superior to relying on reporting from various intermediaries.

### Reduced Counterparty and Systemic Risk

Counterparty risk is one of the most notable risks associated with any type of swap. Since the parties involved in traditional swaps are usually financial institutions or large corporations, counterparty risk is relatively low, though still present.

With DSLA, counterparty risk would be further owing to the fact that all decentralized SLAs are collateralized. Collateralized agreements eliminate the risk of counterparty default and potential knock-on or contagion effects that could follow.

### Opening the Market to Non-Institutional Participants

DSLA's open, peer-to-peer market could democratize access and participation in a market that is usually reserved for only large corporations or financial institutions.

### From Concept to Customer in 48 Hours

With DSLA's [Developer Toolkit (DTK)](https://readme.stacktical.com/developer-guide) any FinTech, InsureTech or enterprising dev team could leapfrog their development roadmap and launch a Tokenized Risk Swap product in a matter of days.

As long as the data are available to define a risk, it can be tokenized and traded peer-to-peer with DSLA. We're excited to be building the first proofs-of-concept on [https://dsla.network](https://dsla.network), and even more excited to see what others build on top of DSLA in the future!
