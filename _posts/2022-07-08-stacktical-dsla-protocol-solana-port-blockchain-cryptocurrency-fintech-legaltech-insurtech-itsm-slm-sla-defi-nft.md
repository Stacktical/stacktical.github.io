## Calling All Solana Savants üßô

We're porting DSLA to Solana and looking to kickstart a decentralized team to make it a happen! Solana will be the seventh network and developer ecosystem that DSLA is available on, and marks the first ***non-EVM*** implementation of DSLA.

Work is underway and the Solana repo is now public on [Github](https://github.com/Stacktical/stacktical-dsla-contracts-solana), so go check it out! Also feel free to hop into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2XhwdRjFnn) server and start chatting about the Solana Port on our shiny new `solana-port` channel.

Audits are being wrapped for DSLA v2.0 right now, which means that the Solana port will start out of the gate with all the added functionality in v2.0.

## What is DSLA? ü§î

DSLA is a Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC) Automation Middleware. DSLA's approach to integrated risk management enables the downside-protected delivery of goods, services and digital assets without intermediaries.

This is accomplished using Service Level Agreements (SLA), a special type of risk management contract that DSLA has rebuit for mass adoption.

## SLA 3.0 : Programmable, Peer-to-Peer, Collateralized

A service level agreement enables you to predict the performance of a service, good or digital asset, using any measurable parameter. Users and Liquidity Providers sign onto the agreement to receive or provide cover, respectively.

To sign onto an agreement, Users and Liquidity Providers each stake cryptocurrency to the agreement's vault.

Actual performance is compared periodically, either weekly or monthly, with the pre-agreed performance target set in the agreement. In the context of DSLA this comparison is called a verification.

Upon verification, if performance targets are met, the developer or Liquidity Providers underwriting the performance earns the right to claim a fraction of user premiums.

Conversely, if the SLA performance targets are missed, the Users hedging against a performance drop earn the right to claim a compensation from the agreement‚Äôs liquidity pool.

The below infographic provides an overview of the SLA Lifecycle in DSLA Protocol.

# Why Solana? 

Solana is highly scalable, with speeds rivaling centralized systems and very low transaction fees. It is an ideal home for web3 projects to deploy and grow.

## Vibrant Developer Community üå±

Solana is one of the most exciting and active blockchain ecosystems in web3. It is not only one of the one of the most active developer communities of all blockchains, it is also consistently one of the fastest growing. The Solana team is also pushing the frontier of web3 forward with initiatives like the Solana Saga and the Solana Mobile Stack SDK.

The developer community on Solana is one of the most innovative in web3, and DSLA will give them a tool to leverage the power of Service Level Agreements (SLA) to manage third party risks. We're beyond excited to see where this can go!

## Mitigating Solana Staking Risks üõ°Ô∏è

Solana is also a great fit for our original flagship use case, providing protection for delegator staking returns. Staking on Solana has the potential to employ slashing, where a portion of all tokens delegated to a validator are destroyed.

Even if a validator is not slashed, returns can be impacted by numerous factors such as: downtime, sub-optimal node configuration, lower end hardware or poor DevOps practices just to name a few.

DSLA's Uptime and Staking Performance SLA's are a perfect fit to complement Solana's staking ecosystem, giving top tier validators a way to stand out and delegators a way to insure their staking returns.

## New Use Cases to Manage Any Third Party Risk ‚ö°

Anyone who develops a new use case is entitled to a portion of the verification fees generated by that use case ***forever***.

The SLA contract is a vehicle for managing performance risk over time, for goods, services and digital assets. Any measurable parameter that can be returned to the SLA contract can be used for setting performance targets and measuring performance.

What sort of parameters? 

Staking APR returns, uptime, response time, delivery time, weather metrics, inflation, digital asset prices or pegged asset volatility just to name a few.

You could develop a use case for fantasy sport star players, protecting average performance per game over a weekly or monthly period.

You could develop a use case for real world battery life of the Solana Sagaüîã.

There are countless ways to leverage DSLA, and we're excited to see what Solana's developer community comes up with!

# We'll be at the Solana Paris Hacker House! üèöÔ∏è

We'll be at [Solana Paris Hacker House](https://solana.com/fi/events/paris-hacker-house) from July 15, 2022 to July 19, 2022.

Come meet up with the DSLA team and let's talk about the DSLA Solana port, risk management, or discuss how your dApp or protocol can benefit from integrating DSLA GRC Automation Middleware!

If you're not going to be at the Paris Hacker House and want to connect, hop into our [Discord](https://discord.gg/2XhwdRjFnn) and we can start chatting about the Solana Port, DSLA or risk management in general!
