## üí° An exciting taste of what's to come!

The [#DubaiDeFi](https://dubaidefi.io) participants did not disappoint! The responses and submissions were fantastic and we are excited for what this represents for DSLA protocol going into 2022 and beyond.

#DubaiDeFi served as a major stepping stone and proof of concept for the future that the core team is building towards. Namely, the development of new use cases by the community and the integration of DSLA protocol by other developers into their own applications. 

Having new use cases built by external developers is how we will truly see DSLA protocol **scale**. It is awesome to see the Developer Toolkit (DTK) get used by developers to build viable, functional use cases for managing risk using DSLA protocol.

We had a number of interesting and innovative submissions, and we are proud to announce DSLA Protocol's prize winners:

### First Place ü•á

**$50K** USD in **$DSLA**: **[$PAR](https://mimo.capital) Peg SLA**. Amazingly this entry was completed in just around 24 hours using the DTK! **$PAR** is [Mimo's](https://mimo.capital) EUR pegged stablecoin and this SLA would provide the ability for holders to mitigate their risk of **$PAR** losing its peg.

### Second Place ü•à

**$25K** USD in **$DSLA**: **Options Factory** by [@DojimaFinance](https://twitter.com/DojimaFinance) for lending and derivatives on Fantom. The option factory can be used for various SLAs including hedging risk on staking returns/yield and hedging risk of loss of peg for stablecoins or other synthetic assets.

### Third Place (TIE) ü•â

There were too many good entries to pick from and we had a tie for third place!

**$10K** USD in **$DSLA**: **Power Plant SLAs** for power plant efficiency. This innovative use case gives the ability to provide an insurance on the efficiency of a solar power plant. OpenRazer API was integrated and used to fetch the data determining efficiency.

**$10K** USD in **$DSLA**: **Google Stackdriver integration using OSS parser**. This submission allows you to fetch SLI data and monitor SLAs using Google Stackdriver, which requires credentials, but with the integration of OSS Parser, the credentials are not visible to the node operator or person providing execution code.

### Other Winners üèÖ

A huge congratulations and thanks go out to all other individuals and teams who participated in #DubaiDeFi. We would also like to congratulate the winners chosen by [Mimo](https://mimo.capital), [Harmony](https://harmony.one), [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation), [Balancer](https://balancer.fi) and [SwissBorg](https://swissborg.com)!

## What's Next

### Closing out #DubaiDeFi

First off - distributing the prizes! Expect this to happen the week ending December 4, 2021.

We're excited to see where the #DubaiDeFi hackathon participants take their works. A number of the entries could be built into viable products that we would love to be able to use in the future.

### Developers Wanted!

Next, we're taking the feedback we received during the hackathon to fine tune the DTK. The core team will continue working to make the DSLA protocol value proposition known and continue onboarding developers to the ecosystem.

For any developers that are interested in starting to BUIDL with DSLA protocol, check out our **[blog post](https://blog.stacktical.com/mainnet/dev/2021/11/15/stacktical-dsla-protocol-dtk-developer-toolkit-getting-started-blockchain-cryptocurrency-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-itsm-slm-sla-defi-nft.html)** announcing the release of the DSLA Developer Toolkit (DTK) or jump right into the **[Developer Guide](https://readme.stacktical.com/developer-guide/developer-toolkit-1/quick-start)**.

### #DubaiDeFi...Round 2 ü•ä

#DubaiDeFi was great and honestly we can't wait to do it all again. Expect some more details on the next #DubaiDeFi hackathon SOON!

We had some feedback during the hackathon that, with the complexity of developing in crypto, giving participants more time will allow for better and more integrated solutions to be submitted. We agree, and with that in mind we plan for the next #DubaiDeFi hackathon to take place over a longer period of time, allowing for more participants to BUIDL cooler stuff!

With that said, there's no time like the present, and the [Developer Toolkit (DTK)](https://github.com/Stacktical/stacktical-dsla-developer-toolkit/) is available now. We would encourage any interested developers to get started today!
