## üí° An exciting taste of what's to come!

The [#DubaiDeFi](https://dubaidefi.io) participants did not disappoint! The responses and submissions by the participants were great and we are excited for what this represents for DSLA protocol going into 2022 and beyond.

#DubaiDeFi served as a major stepping stone and proof of concept for the future that the core team is building towards. Namely, the development of new use cases by the community and the integration of DSLA protocol by other developers into their own applications. 

Having new use cases built by other developers is how we will truly see DSLA protocol **scale**. It is exhilirating to see the Developer Toolkit (DTK) get used by developers to build viable, functional use cases for managing risk using DSLA protocol.

While we had numerous interesting and innovative submissions, we are proud to announce DSLA Protocol's top three picks:

### First Place ü•á

First place and winning XXXXXXXXX DSLA is XXXXXXXX. Use case description. Scaling and future integration comments.

### Second Place ü•à

Second place and winning XXXXXXXXX DSLA is XXXXXXXX. Use case description. Scaling and future integration comments.

### Third Place ü•â

Third place and winning XXXXXXXXX DSLA is XXXXXXXX. Use case description. Scaling and future integration comments.

### Other Winners üèÖ

A huge congratulations and thanks go out to all other individuals and teams who participated in #DubaiDeFi. We would also like to congratulate the winners chosen by [Mimo](https://mimo.capital), [Harmony](https://harmony.one), [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation), [Balancer](https://balancer.fi) and [SwissBorg](https://swissborg.com)!

## What's Next

First off we're excited to see where the #DubaiDeFi hackathon participants take their works. A number of the entries could be built into viable products that we would love to be able to use in the future.

Next, we're be taking feedback to fine tune the DTK. We'll also keep working to make the DSLA protocol value proposition known and continue onboarding developers to the ecosystem.
