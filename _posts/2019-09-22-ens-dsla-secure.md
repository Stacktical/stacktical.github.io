# Stacktical secures the `DSLA.eth` ENS domain name

Today the Stacktical team has been successfully granted the 4 character short `dsla.eth` domain name after review by the Ethereum Name Service(ENS) Team conducted as during the [Short Name Reservation process](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/announcing-the-ens-3-6-character-eth-name-reservation-process-7f3cc4d13f65).
We are glad to own this domain to enrich the experience of the [DSLA Network platform](https://dsla.netowrk).
DSLA Stands for `Decentralized Service Level Agreements`, a reconversion of traditional SLA into Ethereum Smart Contracts that will bring more efficient and transparent Digital agreements with cryptocurrencies service credits compensation when services goes down.

## What is the ENS ?

ENS is the domain name system that is built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain Network.
As you may know, Today's Internet is made of protocols and specifications allowing individuals to access ressourceS using IP addresses.
For example: Stacktical's website servers are reachable through an assigned public IP address that is currently `104.28.26.86`, the drawback being that IP addresses are subject to change and difficult to remember for humans.

Typing `stacktical.com` in a browser is a way more practical and easy to remember for humans thanks to DNS the "phonebook of the internet".

Similarly, ENS eliminates the need to copy the Ethereum Network's 42 characters long addresses:(eg: 0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe) to interract with a Web3.0 Dapps or send money to a friend's Wallet.

ENS is already supported by many mobiles and Desktop wallets, apps and exchanges like Bitfinex.

```
ENS offers a secure & decentralised way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names.
```

## Time for a better, safer, fairer Web

ENS is not just the name service for Ethereum, it's an important piece of the infrastructure promising a better Decentralised Internet.

Nick Johnson and the ENS Team are improving the system, allowing Domains to be transfered easily as NFTs allowing them to be traded on exchanges and most recently the added [Support for Tor onion Address Resolution](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/ens-now-supports-tor-onion-address-resolution-9bb3bdff6217)

The whole Stacktical is thanking the ENS team for the grant of `dsla.eth` and making ENS happen! 

Happy Buidl!
