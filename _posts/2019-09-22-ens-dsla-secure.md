# Stacktical secures the `DSLA.eth` ENS domain name

Today the Stacktical team has been granted the 4 character short `dsla.eth` domain name after review by the Ethereum Name Service(ENS) as part of the Short Name Reservation process.
We are glad to own this domain and that will be put on use by the DSLA Network platform.
DSLA Stands for `Decentralized Service Level Agreements`, a reconversion of traditional SLA into Ethereum Smart Contracts that will bring more efficienta and transparent Digital agreements with automatic cryptocurrencies compensation when services goes down.

## What is the ENS ?

ENS is the domain name system that is built on top of the Ethereum Blockchain Network.
As you may know, Today's Internet is build on top of protocols and specifications allowing individuals to access ressourceS using IP addresses.
For example: Stacktical's website servers are reachable through an assigned public IP address that is currently `104.28.26.86` but that address is subject to change and difficult to remember for humans.
Typing `stacktical.com` is your browser is way more practical and easy to remember for humans thanks to DNS. the "phonebook of the internet".

Similarly, ENS eliminates the need to copy the 42 characters long addresses:(eg: 0x3affcca64c2a6f4e3b6bd9c64cd2c969efd1ecbe) to interract with a Smart contract or send money to a friend's Wallet.
ENS is already supported by many mobiles and Desktop wallets, apps and exchanges like Bitfinex

```
ENS offers a secure & decentralised way to address resources both on and off the blockchain using simple, human-readable names.
```

## Time for a better, safer, fairer Web

ENS is not just the name service for Ethereum, it's an important piece of the infrastructure promising a better Decentralised Internet.
Nick Johnson and the team at ENS are looking and improving the system, allowing Domains to be transfered easily as NFTs allowing them to be traded on exchanges and most recently the added [Support for Tor onion Address Resolution](https://medium.com/the-ethereum-name-service/ens-now-supports-tor-onion-address-resolution-9bb3bdff6217)

The whole Stacktical is thanking the ENS team for the grant of `dsla.eth` and making ENS happen! 

Happy Buidl!
