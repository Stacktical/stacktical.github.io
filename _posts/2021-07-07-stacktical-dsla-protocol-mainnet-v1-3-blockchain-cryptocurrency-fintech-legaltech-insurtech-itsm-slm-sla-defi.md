## SLA Lifecycle Improvements

Dear community, the core development team of DSLA Protocol is pleased to announce that we have successfully deployed **DSLA Protocol v1.3**, to the Ethereum, Kovan and Harmony networks. ðŸŽ‰

The **[DSLA.Network](https://dsla.network/)** flagship application, allowing Proof-of-Stake delegators to insure their deposits against APR drops, has also been updated to interact with this version of the protocol.

Please refer to **[the official Github repository](https://github.com/Stacktical/stacktical-dsla-contracts)** for detailed changes in the DSLA Protocol smart contracts. We will proceed with their verification on Etherscan, and on the new Harmony explorer, in the next couple of days.

**DSLA Protocol v1.3 introduces an on-chain retry mechanism**, to address the oracle failures that prevented some users from claiming their accrued DSLA balance.

It also enables DSLA contract owners to **disable the lock-up period of users premium** as they see fit.

Note that these features are only available at the protocol level for now, not in the DSLA.Network flagship application.

Important: DSLA Protocol v1.3 has not been deployed to Polygon at this stage. We can't guarantee the availability of the protocol in this ecosystem, until further improvements of the indicators we are currently monitoring, including rising fees.

## DSLA Protocol v1.3

Here is a summary of the in-house innovations included in DSLA Protocol v1.3:

* **Risk Prediction Markets**, enabling developers, users, and liquidity providers to trade risk with each other using Decentralized Service Level Agreements (SLA);

* **Leveraged Risk Trading**, enabling developers, users, and liquidity providers to better market their SLA contracts and modulate the cost of SLA premiums;

* **Reliability Forecasts**, enabling third-party risk assessment at a glance, through the wisdom of the SLA marketplace and its participants;

* **SLA Futures Positions**, tokenised LONG/SHORT positions issued to the SLA creator taking on risk (LONG), or to SLA users offsetting risk (SHORT);

* **A Triple Token Design**, to separate the functions of SLA enforcement, and tokenisation of LONG/SHORT SLA positions;

* **SLA Staking Rewards**, to incentivise the creation of decentralized service level agreements, and the availability of subsequent reliability forecasts;

* **Native Token Burns**, everytime a SLA is verified, to ensure the long-term sustainability of DSLA Protocol and utility of DSLA Token;

* **Programmable SLAs**, enabling the addition of new types of SLAs and use cases over time, developed by the community;

* **Developer Tools**, enabling developers to add risk management capabilities to their service, or design risk-aware customer experiences from scratch;

* **No Code Tools**, enabling third-party service providers to add risk management widgets to their service, without technical knowledge.

## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Protocol](/assets/img/dsla-network_device-duo-stacked.jpg)](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xd0fbb87e47da9987d345dbdf3a34d4266cf5ebe9)

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables developers and infrastructure operators to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).
