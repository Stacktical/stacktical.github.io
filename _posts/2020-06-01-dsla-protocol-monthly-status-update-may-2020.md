## Stacktical turns 3 ðŸŽ‚

Did you know that the average lifespan of 90% of technology companies is less than 2 years? 

As we celebrate our third anniversary right in the middle of an unprecedented global crisis, it is humbling to be still around and kicking, more dedicated than ever to sustain the development of DSLA Protocol and the entire family of DSLA products.

Happy birthday to us and courage to our friends going through difficult times right now.  

It's never been more important to care about your customers, and we will keep providing support to the industries that need to reinvent themselves in order to show demonstrable care as an inherent part of their customer experience, and look forward to optimize their financial and non-financial revenue using the DSLA Protocol and the DSLA Network DApp. 

If you're staking service provider or an individual validator, interested in joining our growing list of launch partners, please check out our official partner deck [at this address](https://storage.googleapis.com/stacktical-public/STACKTICAL_DSLA-DECK.pdf). Among other perks, early commitments to use DSLA Protocol as an official launch partners will grant you reduced maintenance fees for SLA checks. 

Let's chat !

We're often mistaken for an insurance solution. It is very much understandable since a SLA contracts protects customers against unforeseen events using financial incentives, often in the form of service credits. But service level agreements are first and foremost a governance vehicle for service providers, meaning it's a framework to design and make decisions to consistently meet quality standards when it comes to delivering data, services, goods and transporting people.  

The upcoming version 4.0.0 of the Stacktical Website aims at demonstrating the capabilities of DSLA Protocol in various industries, and better articulate the benefits of decentralizing a SLA contract, compared to existing centralized Service Level Management (SLM) solutions.

Our objective with the release of DSLA Protocol version 2.0.1 was to provide an end-to-end uptime SLA scenario where a user could be easily compensated for the downtimes of a given website. Feedbacks from the community has helped us identify several issues and areas of improvements that needs to be addressed through a new release.  

DSLA Protocol version 2.1.0 aims at integrating our new Oracle partner to ensure reliable, decentralized periodic SLA checks, and the automated enforcement of SLA policies (e.g. monthly downtime compensation in DSLA token).

#### DSLA Network
**Version 0.9.0 [dsla.network](https://dsla.network)**

| Task        |Â Status           |

| Developments | 0% |
| Quality Assurance | 0% |
| Release ETA | **Q3 2020** |  

* **The new DSLA Network DApp is being developed right now.**

The flagship use case of DSLA Protocol is to secure staking rewards against slashing penalties and unfulfilled reliability promises. It's a great way for staking service providers to meet quality standards and de-risk staking for their delegators.   

While this is something we're already explicitely mentioning on the [DSLA Network homepage](https://dsla.network/), the Proof-of-Stake blockchain networks and assets that will be supported by the protocol have yeat to appear somewhere on the DApp. Version 0.9.0 of DSLA Network will introduce a series of change in the SLA creation workflow, and introduce a Staking SLA along with the existing Uptime SLA.

Wilhem has discussed with the top management of the world's best staking service providers to establish a list of priority networks and assets that should be made available at launch. It goes without saying that we plan on supporting Kusama and Polkadot from the get-go, as we're working on our W3F grant assignments.
