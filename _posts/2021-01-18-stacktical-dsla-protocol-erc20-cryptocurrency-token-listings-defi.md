## DSLA Staking

While a lot of the conversation has surrounded the compensation capabilities of DSLA Protocol, DSLA Staking is one of the most important pilars of the DSLA experience, and a key utility of the DSLA token.

To give service customers access to a rich, open marketplace of peer-to-peer service level agreements, we designed DSLA Staking Rewards as crypto-economic incentives that stimulate the creation of agreements, and justify adding liquidity to existing agreement pools to further empower possible compensation claims. 

A two-step, "create and stake" process we call **Vouching**.

Vouchers are liquidity providers that guarantee the connectivity, performance or availability of a service they do not necessarily operate themselves. In exchange for expanding the list of available hedges on the DSLA contract marketplace, and supporting third-party staking pool operators in their site reliability engineering efforts, DSLA Protocol reward vouching positions, by continuously depleting the insurance premium deposited by proof-of-stake delegators.

This enables DSLA Protocol to ensure better compliance of its operations and create value for liquidity providers beyond generating groundless yields, or capturing protocol fees.

## ERC20 Stablecoins Pools

Along with DSLA token staking, we are excited to announce that DSLA Protocol will also support DAI and USDC stablecoin staking at launch. 

DAI and USDC will be added to the DSLA contract creation workflow, and will provide a simple option to reduce proof-of-stake delegators exposure to the volatility of the DSLA token, while enabling liquidity providers to remain exposed to DSLA if that's their wish.

This addition will reinforce DSLA Protocol's ability to secure the $35M value immediately at risk in proof-of-stake networks from day one, a value exceeding the current market capitalization of DSLA token at the time of writing.

## ERC20 Tokens Pools

Last but not least, we are proud to announce that we are working with selected partners to add support for their own ERC20 asset to DSLA Protocol, as part of our whitelabeling and branding effort for proof-of-stake network core development teams. 

Just like it does for DSLA Maxima on Elrond to use eGLD as a native currency, it makes sense for a service customer to claim her third-party cryptocurrency, if it is available.

This is especially true if DSLA Protocol is transparently integrated with the provider's service, network and application experience.


## Cross-Chain Buy Back

In its first year of operation, 50% of all fees captured while using different cryptocurrencies in DSLA contract liquidity pools on the Ethereum mainnet, will be converted back to DSLA ERC20 tokens, and added to the protocol's treasury. 

The buybacks will be transparently documented in a monthly report, and the funds auditable by our community. The treasury will serve as a foundation for our upcoming governance efforts, an important topic we will make sure to articulate in a dedicated post soon.

## Conclusion

Our vision for the future is that every company in the world will be represented by its own cryptocurrency asset. Itâ€™s only natural to make sure that DSLA Protocol can support these assets, to pave the way to customer experience automation practices that are on par with existing branding and loyalty efforts of IaaS, PaaS and SaaS companies.

## About DSLA Protocol
![DSLA Protocol, Elrond Edition](/assets/img/dsla-network_square-hand-shot-social_elrond.png)

As users outsource increasingly more functions of their lives and businesses to third-party service providers, they need better ways to manage their exposure to third-party infrastructure risk. Especially when money is at stake.

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that gives anyone the ability to create, monitor and execute decentralized service level agreements and parametric insurance policies.

When the monitored performance of a service is within the thresholds of an agreement, third-party service providers and liquidity providers earn the right to claim a reward from the agreement liquidity pool. Conversely, when an agreement is violated, customers earn the right to claim a compensation. 

Win-Win.
