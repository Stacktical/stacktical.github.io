## Trade DSLA/ETH now üöÄ

Dear community and valued customers, we inform you that the DSLA token has debuted trading under the DSLA/ETH pair, on the **[IDEX decentralized cryptocurrency exchange](https://exchange.idex.io/trading/DSLA-ETH)**.

Acquiring DSLA tokens will enable you to provision your Decentralized Service Level Agreements, and use the staking, rewarding, and compensation features of the DSLA Protocol and the **[DSLA Network √êapp](https://dsla.network)**.

IDEX is arguably one of the most important decentralized exchange created, and has been leading the industry for years. They recently announced a $2.5 million seed investment, to launch IDEX 2.0, their novel high-performance DEX.

Start trading DSLA/ETH  **[now](https://exchange.idex.io/trading/DSLA-ETH)**.

## 0-fee DSLA trading with IDEX 2.0

The DSLA token still largely relies on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, Mooniswap and Balancer to be adopted. Although Ethereum developers are actively working on ETH 2.0, and solutions to the high fees problem, the recent spike in fees when interacting with DSLA DEX pools did impact our project's ability to grow.

One of the key reasons why we wanted to parter with IDEX, is the upcoming IDEX 2.0 version of their exchange. IDEX 2.0 is powered by an innovative Layer-2 scaling solution that will enable a performance on par with centralized exchanges, and 0-fee for trading DSLA. 

The best of two worlds.

## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Token, now on Argent wallet](/assets/img/2020-08-26-dsla-token-available-on-Argent-keyless-wallet-screenshot.jpg)](https://stacktical.com)

[DSLA Protocol](https://stacktical.com) is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

DSLA Protocol's flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of Proof-of-Stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the connectivity, performance and availability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers.
