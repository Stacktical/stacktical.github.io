## Trade DSLA/ETH now 🚀

Dear community and valued customers, we inform you that the DSLA token has debuted trading under the DSLA/ETH pair, on the **[IDEX decentralized cryptocurrency exchange](https://idex.market/eth/dsla)**.

Acquiring DSLA tokens will enable you to provision your Decentralized Service Level Agreements, and use the staking, rewarding, and compensation features of the DSLA Protocol and the **[DSLA Network Ðapp](https://dsla.network)**.

IDEX is arguably one of the most important decentralized exchange created, and has been leading the industry for years. They recently announced a $2.5 million seed investment, to launch IDEX 2.0, their novel high-performance DEX.

Start trading DSLA/ETH  **[now](https://idex.market/eth/dsla)**.

## 0-fee DSLA trading with IDEX 2.0

The DSLA token still largely relies on decentralized exchanges like Uniswap, Mooniswap and Balancer to be adopted. Although Ethereum developers are actively working on ETH 2.0, and solutions to the high fees problem, the recent spike in fees when interacting with DSLA DEX pools did impact our project's ability to grow.

One of the key reasons why we wanted to parter with IDEX, is the upcoming IDEX 2.0 version of their exchange. IDEX 2.0 is powered by an innovative Layer-2 scaling solution that will enable a performance on par with centralized exchanges, and 0-fee for trading DSLA. 

The best of two worlds.

## About the DSLA Protocol

![DSLA Protocol](https://storage.googleapis.com/stacktical-public/dsla-protocol_by_stacktical.png) 

**DSLA Protocol is a decentralized alternative to SLA contracts.**

It enables anyone to vouch for the reliability of a service, earn rewards when the service performs as expected, and claim financial compensation when the service doesn’t meet expectations. 

DSLA Protocol and the DSLA.network Ðapp, will debut an incentivized beta in Q4 2020, focusing on providing a hedge against staking risks, and unfulfilled reliability promises.
