## Our 15d for 15M trial DSLA Community Faucet was a success

Dear champions, we are proud to announce that DSLA Community Faucet, a smart faucet that rewards users in DSLA tokens, for providing liquidity on [the official DSLA-ETH pair on Uniswap](https://uniswap.info/pair/0xd0fbb87e47da9987d345dbdf3a34d4266cf5ebe9), has **crossed the 100,000 USD in total deposits**!  

> By giving Uniswap liquidity providers the ability to farm DSLA tokens in exchange for UNI-V2 LP tokens, **the DSLA Uniswap pool has been able to cross 250,000 USD in total liquidity**.  

To the DSLA core team, this is proof that the DSLA Community Faucet creates sustainable incentives to improve the trading conditions of the community on Uniswap. 

We would like to thank all liquidity providers for contributing their precious DSLA and ETH to our pool, and for staking their UNI-V2 LP tokens to the DSLA Community Faucet during the 15 days trial.

## We're extending the Program for 120 days

Following our successful 15 days trial, we are extending the DSLA Liquidity Mining Progam to 120 days. 30,000,000 (30M) DSLA have been added to the DSLA Community Faucet, to reward Uniswap liquidity providers.

### Up to 3ùô≠ Bonus Multiplier üêã

The more DSLA liquidity you provide, and for longer, the greater share of the faucet pool you receive:

* If you stake for **a month**, you get **2ùô≠** the rewards.  
* If you stake for **two months**, you get **3ùô≠** the rewards.   

We advise you try to keep stakes for at least 8 weeks to maximize rewards.

### Next stop: 1,000,000 USD on Uniswap üî•

With the continuous support of our community and the contribution of Uniswap liquidity providers, our objective with this updated program is to reach at least 1M USD liquidity in the DSLA Uniswap pool by the end of the year 2020. 

Our research shows that it is the threshold needed for DSLA Protocol and the DSLA.network √êapp to begin the next stage of their growth on the mainnet.
