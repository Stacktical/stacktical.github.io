## Disco Inferno

On November 30, 11:11 CET, Stacktical, the core development team of DSLA Protocol, will proceed with a 2,000,000,000.00 (2 Billion) DSLA token burn as part of its [Suspicion Activity Report (SAR) Mitigation Plan](https://blog.stacktical.com/post-mortem/security/2020/11/14/suspicious-activity-report-mitigation-plan.html), and to further pave the way to the DSLA Protocol and DSLA.network √êapp mainnet launches this year.

Here are 5 key information you absolutely need to know about the event:

#### 1. ‚òùÔ∏è Total Supply will decrease to 7B DSLA

DSLA tokens have been issued in the Billions, for the DSLA Protocol to empower use cases across a wide variety of industries beyond staking, and settle breached / honoured DSLA contracts using integer numbers. 

After the event, the maximum number of DSLA tokens in existence will be 7,000,000,000.00 (7 Billion) DSLA, a 28.5% decrease from 9,000,000,000.00 (9 Billion).

#### 2. ‚úåÔ∏è Circulating Supply will cross 90% of Total Supply

Most of the DSLA tokens burned during the event are not circulating. 

Not only the current number of DSLA tokens circulating on the market will not be affected by the DSLA token burn event, but this number will also increase and cross 90% of all DSLA tokens in existence. 

More than ever, our tokenomics will send a strong signal that our community is ready to write the next chapter of DSLA Protocol and the DSLA family of products.

#### 3. ü§ü Current Individual Holdings will increase by 28.5%

By decreasing the DSLA Total Supply by 28.5%, each DSLA Holders will equally hold 28.5% more of the fully diluted Market Cap of DSLA. For example, an individual holding 30M DSLA will see her holding percentage increase from 0.33% to 0.42%. 

A provable increase in community power.

#### 4. üçÄ Current Core Team Holdings will decrease by 70%

The increase in community power is the result of our core development team, and selected partners, agreeing to decrease their own DSLA holdings. 

Here is a breakdown of our commitment : 

*(TBB = To Be Burned)*

##### üëù Company Reserve :
300,000,000.00 (300M) DSLA TBB üî•

##### üéí Core Team Wallet :
1,100,000,000.00 (1.1B) DSLA TBB üî•

##### üíº Team & Partners :
600,000,000.00 (600M) DSLA TBB üî•

#### 5. üëã DSLA Total Supply will keep decreasing over time

DSLA Protocol has a built-in token burn mechanism. On the mainnet, DSLA contract bonus claims involving liquidity pools in DSLA tokens will trigger a DSLA utility burn, to incentivize DSLA stakeholders.
