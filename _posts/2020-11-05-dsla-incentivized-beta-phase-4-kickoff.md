## About DSLA Protocol

![DSLA Network, the flagship application of DSLA Protocol, a risk management protocol for developers](/assets/img/dsla-network_screenshot_iphone-duo.png)

DSLA is a risk management protocol for developers, to build applications and operate infrastructures that are natively capable of financially protecting users against failures. 

It enables anyone to vouch for the reliability of a service, get paid when the service performs as expected, or get compensated when the service does not meet expectations.
