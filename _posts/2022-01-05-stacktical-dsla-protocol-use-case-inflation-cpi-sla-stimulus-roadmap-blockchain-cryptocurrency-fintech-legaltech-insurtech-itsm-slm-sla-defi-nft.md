## Decentralized Stimulus Checks

Dear members of the DSLA community, stakeholders of the future of the Internet, we are excited to announce that we have added support for **Inflation Rate SLAs** to [DSLA Protocol](https://stacktical) and the [DSLA.Network](https://dsla.network) flagship application. üéâ

Inflation Rate SLAs are Decentralized Service Level Agreements for managing your exposure to month-on-month inflation rates. They enable you to open **interest-bearing SLA Positions** by either:

* **Taking on inflation risk from peers** (bullish bias on inflation, for a given period), or,
* **Transferring inflation risk to a peer** (bearish bias on inflation, for a given period)

To mitigate inflation, governements implement large-scale monetary policy updates, such as raising central bank interest rates, to cool off the economy. But inflation is not inherently bad, and outdated governance tools can't provide a differentiated approach when it comes to managing exposure to Consumer Price Index (CPI) fluctuations. By decentralising inflation-driven policies, Inflation Rate SLAs are a radical departure from traditional inflation risk management

## The 1st real hedging instrument against inflation

DSLA Protocol's new Inflation Rate SLA is a radical departure from traditional inflation risk management approaches. 

Our research show that most organizations and individuals are not prepared for the acceleration of global inflation in 2022. Inflation and Consumer Price Index (CPI) metrics are too disconnected from information systems to drive decisions. Whether they want to can capitalise on inflation or hedge against it is irrelevant. Until now, they lacked a way to actively manage their exposure to inflation 

The DSLA Protocol core team has been **pioneering a decentralized alternative to service level agreements since 2018**.
