## Edition #3 was a success

We came, we saw, we burned! 

**101,000,000.00 (101M) DSLA tokens** were burned during Bonfire Burn Event #3! ðŸ”¥

The fires have been stoked and we are as well.

## Edition #3 Proof of Burns

101,000,000.00 DSLA ERC20 tokens were burned on [Jan 21 2022](https://coinmarketcal.com/en/coin/dsla-protocol):

# The Future of Burns

### New Native Burn Mechanism 

Up until now, DSLA tokens were burned upon SLA verifications, a core maintain task of DSLA Protocol.

In 2022, DSLA tokens will be burned for completing other maintenance tasks.

#### DSLA Metaverse

In the DSLA Metaverse, NFT will be minted using DSLA tokens.

A fraction of the DSLA Metaverse minting fees will be burned forever.

#### DSLA Protocol v2.0 - Claiming Fees

DSLA Protocol charges a claiming fee, upon withdrawing (accrued) liquidity from a SLA contract. 

A fraction of the DSLA Protocol claiming fees will be burned forever.

#### DSLA Protocol v2.0 - Trigger Fees

As a Risk Management Middleware, **the scope of DSLA Protocol goes beyond claims and the economic settlement of third-party service failures**. 

This year, we are introducing a new iniative called DSLA Triggers. 

It will enables new, powerful outcomes following SLA verifications:

* Account termination
* Account update
* Account migration
* Risk Parameters Update
* Compliance Reporting

### Ready for generation deflation?

In all cases, an exponential usage of DSLA Protocol will translate into an exponential burn of DSLA tokens reflecting this reality.
