## Edition #2 was a success

Dear community, as DSLA Protocol lays the groundwork for scaling, we're pleased to announce that we have successfully proceeded with the burn of **20,511,384 DSLA tokens** during our Bonfire Burn Event #2. üî• 

As noted in the [Bonfire Burn Event #1 report](https://blog.stacktical.com/bonfire/reporting/2021/08/27/stacktical-dsla-protocol-bonfire-burn-event-1-blockchain-cryptocurrency-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-itsm-slm-sla-defi-nft.html), the Bonfire Burn Event #2 and all future events will focus on protocol-driven token burns, and sharing proper usage analytics that the team will use to drive quarterly goals and decisions.

Nonetheless, the DSLA Protocol core development made sure to double down on its commitment to the fair distribution of DSLA with a surprise buyback and burn of 50 ETH worth of DSLA tokens, approximately 200K USD at the time of burn.  

Overall, for the Bonfire Burn Event #2, we had a Protocol burn of **420,000 DSLA tokens** and a surprise buyback and burn of **20,091,384 DSLA tokens** for a total of **20,511,384 DSLA tokens** burned.

With the recent roll out of stablecoin and native currency support by the DSLA Protocol core team, the stage is set for DSLA to work on our usage analytics and grow to the next level.

### Bonfire Application

During the incenvitized beta test of the DSLA Protocol, the "Bonfire" designated the social space of the [DSLA.Network](https://dsla.network/) flagship application. It's a feature we imagine could bring our community members together around the key metrics of the DSLA family of products.

Our core team is working on bringing a Bonfire √êapp to life to achieve this very goal! More information about this new initiative soon!
