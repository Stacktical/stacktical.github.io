> Stacktical and XYO announce their partnership to empower the future of Internet of Things* (IoT) by using their respective technology to use data resulting from the geolocation of goods connected with the blockchain in transparent and auditable conditions.

PARIS, FRANCE — Stacktical, a Blockchain platform for managing Service Level Agreements (SLA), and XYO, the first geospatial blockchain network, are joining forces to integrate geospatial Decentralized Service Level Agreements (DSLA) into the digital ecosystem of Internet of Things (IoT).

One sector in particular, the airline industry, faces critical challenges. In year 2018 only, over 20 million luggage were declared lost by airline companies, and a record number of flight delays were reported. In this context, easing the customer experience by providing airline companies technologically advanced ways to track their mobile goods, but also providing effortless ways to access compensation to travelers are urgent.

Our shared goal is to use our respective platforms such as the geolocalization sensors developed by XYO network and the Decentralized Service Level Agreements provided by Stacktical to help airline companies transparently commit to the end-to-end tracking of luggage using connected devices but also instantly compensate travellers when service levels agreed by airlines companies are not met.

>**Together, Stacktical and XYO can decentralize The Flight Compensation Regulation 261/2004 that entitles travelers to compensation following flight delays. But contrary to fintech companies in this space, we are not interested in collecting fees in exchange for managing travelers claims: we are removing the very need for claims using smart contracts, cryptocurrencies and IoT devices”,** commented Wilhem Pujar CEO and co-founder of Stacktical.

>**“XYO and Stacktical brings a new generation of guarantees that scales from the logistics of luggage by airlines to Food delivery. With cryptographically-backed geospatial data tied to cryptographically-secure SLA Smart Contracts a whole new level of automation is achievable to benefits consumers and service providers just like we do with online services”**, commented Jean-Daniel Bussy CTO and co-founder of Stacktical.**

**About XYO**

The XYO Network is a Blockchain crypto-location oracle network backed by cryptography. Their Partners include mapping giant Esri, Re/Max Mexico and Spaceflight Industries. XYO Advisors come from leading organizations including National Geographic and the World Economic Forum.

**About Stacktical**

Powered by the DSLA token, Stacktical is a Service Level Agreement (SLA) platform for documenting, bargaining and tracking service commitments between service providers, their partners and their customers. Stacktical ambitions to better align the interests of all service stakeholders with the Stacktical platform by creating a trustless network of highly automated agreements that can boost employee morale and settle customer disputes using DSLA token service credits. We hope to bring new levels of efficiency and trust in tracking scenario and in the settlement of tracking failures.
