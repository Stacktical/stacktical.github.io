## Cross-chain DSLA transfers are coming

Dear community, in our effort to expand DSLA Protocol to other blockchain networks through the DSLA Maxima initiative, and after our successful experiment with the Polygon network, we are proud to announce that the DSLA token is currently being integrated to multiple other blockchain ecosystems, and will soon exist in different token standards!

Whether available through a bridge or in as a wrapped asset, this integration will enable the DSLA token to retain its utility across all ports of DSLA Protocol, and tap into the respective powers and DeFi stack of partnering networks.

We look forward to unveil our new bridge integration and more this week.

## About DSLA Protocol

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements and bonus-malus insurance policies.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).
