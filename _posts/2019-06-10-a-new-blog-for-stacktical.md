## Changing how we tell stories

One of my main objectives for the past year has been to cultivate our ability to write engaging content about the Stacktical ecosystem. Between the mathematical models that we use to predict the scalability of systems, our ongoing efforts in decentralizing service level agreements and our daily operations, there are endless opportunities to share insights with our **[ever growing community](https://t.me/stacktical){:target="_blank"}**.

So far, our **[Medium](https://medium.com/stacktical){:target="_blank"}** publications have proved useful in doing exactly that, often through rendez-vous like our weekly status updates. But in order to ensure your ability to consume Stacktical content without restrictions in the long run, we've decided to embrace a more open alternative as our main communication channel.

Moving forward, the Stacktical Blog at **[blog.stacktical.com](https://blog.stacktical.com){:target="_blank"}** will your premier destination for product, market and corporate news about Stacktical and the DSLA token. We are ready to double down on blogging while venturing into new, multimedia grounds.  

Thank you for visiting!
