We are pleased to inform the community that the DSLA utility token will be listed on the **[MXC cryptocurrency exchange](https://www.mxc.com/)** on **Friday, February 5th, 2021 at 4am CET / 11am CST** ! üéâ

MXC is a **[Top 50 CoinMarketCap exchange](https://coinmarketcap.com/rankings/exchanges/)**, with more than $1B in daily trading volume. 

This 4th bridge listing will further allow DSLA to be eligible for proper ranking on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dsla-protocol/), support the recent rocket growth of DSLA token holders, as well as provide a cheaper alternative to Uniswap and the unbearable gas fees our community has been experiencing for the past weeks.

## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Token, now on Argent wallet](/assets/img/2020-08-26-dsla-token-available-on-Argent-keyless-wallet-screenshot.jpg)](https://stacktical.com)

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables businesses to reduce their customers exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements and bonus-malus insurance policies.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).
