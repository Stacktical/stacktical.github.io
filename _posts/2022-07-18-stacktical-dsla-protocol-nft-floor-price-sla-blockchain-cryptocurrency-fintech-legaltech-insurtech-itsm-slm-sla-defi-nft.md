## Game Changing Protection for NFTs ☂️

NFTs exploded into the mainstream consciousness in 2021 and the market continues to rapidly evolve and grow through 2022. As one of the newer elements in the web3 space though, NFTs lack some of the robust ecosystem tools that have been growing alongside the standard web3 token economy for the past 5+ years.

NFT Floor Price Protection, powered by DSLA GRC Automation Middleware, fills a gap in the NFT ecosystem by providing decentralized risk management and downside protection for NFTs. Let's take a look. 👇

### NFT Floor Price Protection

The Floor is Lava!🌋

DSLA's NFT Floor Price Protection allows creators and projects to offer floor price protection using a decentralized Service Level Agreement (SLA) for their NFT collections; this differentiates their project to attract collectors. On the flip side, NFT collectors can buy a new NFT with confidence, hedging their risk of floor price drops (downside risk) and getting compensated if the target floor price is not maintained.

Providing this type of smart-contract-backed downside protection for NFT collectors is a web3 first, and we've received a lot of interest from creators!

### More Than Just a Floor 💡

Floor price protection is a game changer for projects, creators and collectors, but another feature of our decentralized SLAs gives the NFT Floor Price SLA even more utility. To understand the opportunity we need to look at how SLAs work. There are two sides to every SLA:

* One side joins to **Cover** a risk they are exposed to. In this case NFT Collectors join an Agreement to **Cover** the risk of the floor price dropping below a target price for the NFT that they own.
* The other side joins to **Clear** that risk - aka *providing the cover*. NFT Creators and backers join to **Clear** risk of price drops (they provide the protection to NFT Collectors). They earn a reward from the NFT collector stakes when the NFT floor stays above the target price.

With DSLA being permissionless and open, anyone can sign onto the SLA to either **Cover** risk or **Clear** risk. This opens new ways for people to interact with the NFT market.

- Collectors sign on to **Cover** the risk of floor price drops for an NFT they own.
- Creators sign on to **Clear** risk for collectors, backing their NFT collection floor price and making the project more attractive.
- Users who don't want to buy and hold a potentially illiquid JPEG can have exposure to the NFT market by backing a NFT Floor Price SLA according to whether they think the Floor Price will be maintained or not. They can **Cover** or **Clear** risk to benefit from predicting floor price moves without owning the NFT.
- Users who might not have thousands of dollars to buy an NFT can still take part in the NFT market through the Floor Price Protection SLA

This is an entirely new market for NFTs where anyone can sign onto the SLA and be rewarded if the collection performs according to their prediction. Users can **Cover** risk and be compensated if the floor price drops below the target or users can **Clear** risk and be rewarded rewarded if the floor price stays above the target.

> Unlike fractionalized NFTs, NFT Floor Price SLAs allow users with smaller bankrolls to participate without the risk of being stuck with an illiquid JPEG, or an even more illiquid "fraction of a JPEG."

### Pixelmon Holders, Sorry We Weren't Ready Sooner 👹😔

All kidding aside, the Pixelmon debacle is a great example of where NFT Floor Price Protection would have been beneficial. It serves as a case study on why NFT downside protection is all the more valuable going forward.

Looking at what happened with Pixelmon we can easily visualize where the market created by an NFT Floor Price SLA would have interested NFT investors on both sides - those who believed the floor price would be maintained and those who did not.

We're very excited to launch DSLA NFT Floor Price Protection and can see it becoming one of the fastest growing parts of the DSLA GRC Automation Middleware ecosystem!
