## DSLA zkEVM Œ≤eta ü•∑

Zero-Knowledge rollups are an extremely promising scaling solution for Ethereum that provide the robust security of a public blockchain with the added benefit of preserving privacy for users. With zkEVMs, protocols can port their existing Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible solidity contracts directly to a zkEVM rollup and take advantage of these scalability and privacy benefits.

We are very excited to begin beta testing DSLA on the [ConsenSys zkEVM Public Testnet](https://consensys.net/blog/research-development/consensys-zkevm-is-ready-for-public-testnet/), bringing the power of privacy-enabled SLAs to DSLA -- welcome **zkDSLA**.

## Benefits of zkDSLA ‚úÖ

While the public nature of blockchains is one of the strengths of the technology, there are many cases where businesses and individuals may desire privacy. With DSLA being expanded to a zkEVM rollup, privacy will be an option with DSLA for SLA participants who need or want it.

In addition to privacy, zkEVM rollups deliver high speed and low cost transactions for users and do not have the same finality or withdrawal delays that optimistic rollups require. 

Keeping SLA data private is desirable in a number of foreseeable circumstances. In cases where DSLA may supplant a traditional contract or legal agreement, confidentiality of terms and participants may be both expected and required. Non-disclosure agreements (NDA) are common in the contractig world and zkDSLA would enable companies under NDA to securely and privately leverage DSLA's technology.

Another benefit of zkDSLA would be that it can help to engineer around the manipulation of prediction markets by ill intended parties. Said another way, some SLA's could potentially be seen as creating a honey-pot that would reward an adversarial party for attacking the service that is being covered.

## Potential Use Cases üßê

Let's discuss a couple potential use cases that may benefit from the privacy enabled by zkDSLA.

### Third-Party Logistics (3PL) service providers

Major 3PL service providers could benefit from the automation and security of using DSLA to guarantee certain performance KPI's to their customers. However, different customers may have different guarantees and different compensation amounts in event of a service lapse. Keeping the KPI's and penalties for different customers confidential would be necessary.

Private SLAs would also help mitigate the risk of an adversarial party signing onto an SLA and then proceeding to try to disrupt service to earn a reward.

### Travel SLA's

We've discussed how DSLA may enable the travel insurance of the future, where your holistic *travel experience* is covered, rather than just something like flight delays.

With such an SLA-based coverage your travel experience data points may encompass flight delays, weather at your destination, availability of major attractions etc. While this novel type of travel coverage is exciting, many people would understandably not want the corresponding details of their trip publicly available on the blockchain for anyone to see.

In this situation, the privacy preserving aspects of zkDSLA would be very desirable.

### Anywhere a Confidentiality Clause or NDA is Used

As we touched on above, any service where a confidentiality clause or NDA would be used to cover the terms of the agreement would be a potential candidate for zkDSLA. As a result, a zero-knowledge deployment has the potential to expand DSLA's reach by an order of magnitude!

We're excited to start testing this exciting deployment and look forward to the zero-knowledge future!
