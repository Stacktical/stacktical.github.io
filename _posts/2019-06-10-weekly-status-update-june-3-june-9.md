### <i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Finance & Operations

#### Finance / Cryptocurrency Exchange Listing

| Task or Indicator        | Value |
| :------------- | :-------------|
| Pre-agreements (DEX) | **0 out of 3 objective(s)** |
| Pre-agreements (Centralized) | **1 out of 1 objective(s)** |
| DSLA Listing Status | 33% (1/3) |
| DSLA ROI since ICO | N/A |  
| DSLA Listing ETA | **July 2019** |

* We have reached a pre-agreement with a centralized cryptocurrency exchange.
* We have approached major DEX platform that we have been experimenting with for the past weeks.  

We're hoping that having DSLA also listed on a DEX, along with being listed on centralized exchanges, will provide more options to the community.

#### Finance / Ops

* In preparation for exchange listing, we plan on burning 1B DSLA tokens.

This will reduce the total supply from 10B to 9B DSLA.

#### Legal / Ops

* To improve our efficiency in dealing reaching agreements with our stakeholders, the Legal Team has started refactoring the different steps of our legal lifecycle. Our Legal Manager will introduce a series of flow charts describing improved operations.  
* We have initiated a series of workshop to ensure the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance of the upcoming DSLA Network.
