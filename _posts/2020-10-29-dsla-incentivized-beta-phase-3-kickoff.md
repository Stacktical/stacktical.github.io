## 🏆 Phase II Report

Thank you for your participating in the Phase II of the DSLA incentivized beta! 

DSLA core developers are humbled by the response of the community 🙏 :

#### 🔥 More than 10M bDSLA tokens staked
#### 🔥 More than 10 DSLA contracts created

With nearly 50% of the bDSLA token supply already locked in DSLA Contracts, the decrease in staking activity was bound to happen. 

Great insights, Champions!

Phase III will vastly improve the liquidity and velocity of bDSLA tokens, we're looking forward to analysis the results.

## 💡 Feature Spotlight

### #1 Ability to claim bDSLA compensations / rewards

35+ DSLA Contracts have been created during the Phase I and II of the DSLA incentivized beta. But bDSLA staking rewards are yet to be distributed to Delegators, Validators and their Vouchers.

Based on the measured Harmony (ONE) Staking Efficiency of our partners, the P-OPS and Chainode Tech validators, bDSLA rewards and compensations will become self-claimable by DSLA Contract stakeholders and the end of Phase III:

* **A Delegator** will be able to claim 99.7% of her initial stake if her agreement is breached (0.3% claiming fees);  

* **A Validator** will be able to claim 19.94% of their Delegators stake if her agreement is honoured (0.3% claiming fees);  

* **A Voucher** will be able to claim 15.95% of Delegators stake if her agreement is honoured (0.3% claiming fees + 20% commission to the Validator she vouches for).

### #2 Instant token burn of claiming fees

For every claim at the end of a Phase, the DSLA Protocol will charge and burn 0.3% claiming fee to Delegators, Validators and Vouchers. All tokens burned by the DSLA Protocol during DSLA claims are removed from circulation forever.
