## üî© What can you build on DSLA Protocol?

Developers can use the **[DSLA Developer Toolkit (DTK)](https://github.com/Stacktical/stacktical-developer-toolkit)** to **build service-level agreements** matching one of the following DeFi use case:

| USE CASE | DESCRIPTION |
| -------------- | ---------------|
| APR/APY SLA | Hedge against diminishing staking returns and yields |
| Uptime SLA | Hedge against application, network and service downtimes |
| Response Time SLA | Hedge against slow application, network and service |
| Withdrawal Time SLA | Hedge against third party custodian lock-up |
| Impermanent Loss SLA | Hedge against negative market making returns |
| Peg SLA | Hedge against stablecoin and synthetic assets losing their peg |

e.g. Build a **$PAR Peg SLA**, to hedge against $PAR losing its peg against EUR.

üí° **You are welcome to combine any number of sponsor platform in your developments, to maximize your chances of winning and the size of your prize.**
