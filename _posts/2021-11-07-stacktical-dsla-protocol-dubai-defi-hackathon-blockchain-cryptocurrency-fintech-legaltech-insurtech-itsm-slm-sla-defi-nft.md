## ‚å®Ô∏è Developers, Developers, Developers

Are you ready?

We are thrilled to announce that the [DSLA Protocol](https://stacktical.com) and [Mimo](https://mimo.capital) core development teams are co-organizing [**Dubai DeFi**](https://dubaidefi.io), the biggest hackathon in the Arabian Peninsula!

**Over 300,000.00 USD in prizes will be awarded to developers building the best products around DSLA Protocol, Mimo, and other #DubaiDeFi sponsors [Harmony](https://harmony.one), [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation), [Balancer](https://balancer.fi), [SwissBorg](https://swissborg.com).**

And guess what...

## üèÅ The competition starts... now !

You can already submit your repository anytime **from now through November 27, 2021 to projects@dubaidefi.io**, to participate to the hackathon.

Sponsors will be hosting live sessions on Twitch starting **November 12th** to provide technical details about their platforms and assist competitors.

üí° Make sure to check out all #DubaiDeFi information at [https://dubaidefi.io](https://dubaidefi.io).

## üçÄ Prize Pools & Product Expectations

Each sponsor will choose their own winner(s) and how to distribute their respective prize pools. Here is the current level of commitment from participating #DubaiDeFi sponsors:  

* **$150K** in **$MIMO**  
* **$100K** in **$DSLA**  
* **$50K** in **$ONE**  
* **$25K** in **$FTM**  
* **$10K** in **$CHSB**  

As far as DSLA Protocol is concerned, we are expecting developers to use the DSLA Developer Toolkit (DTK) to build a hedging product matching one of the following DeFi use case:

| USE CASE | DESCRIPTION |
| -------------- | ---------------|
| APR/APY SLA | Hedge against diminishing staking returns and yields |
| Uptime SLA | Hedge against application, network and service downtimes |
| Response Time SLA | Hedge against slow application, network and service |
| Withdrawal Time SLA | Hedge against third party custodian lock-up |
| Impermanent Loss SLA | Hedge against negative market making returns |
| Peg SLA | Hedge against stablecoin and synthetic assets losing their peg |

e.g. Build a **$PAR Peg SLA**, to hedge against $PAR losing its peg against EUR.

**üí° Of course, you are welcome to combine any number of sponsor platform in your developments. The winners and prizes will be announced live from Mimo's offices in Dubai on November 27, 2021!**

## üìî DSLA Protocol Developer Guide 

We will publish a lot more comprehensive instructions about getting involved with #DubaiDeFi soon, but our [Developer Guide](https://readme.stacktical.com/developer-guide/developer-toolkit-1/quick-start) is definitely a good place to get started.
