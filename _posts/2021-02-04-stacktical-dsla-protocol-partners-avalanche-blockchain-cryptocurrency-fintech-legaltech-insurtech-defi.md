## DSLA Protocol for Avalanche

DSLA Protocol enables anyone to add a service level agreement on top of any third-party service, to reduce customers exposure to infrastructure risks and incentivise the connectivity, performance and availability of services, networks and applications over time.

To bring our developer community access to more technologies, we are proud to announce that we are joining forces with Ava Labs, to launch DSLA Maxima “Avalanche Edition”, a maximalist port of DSLA Protocol on the Avalanche blockchain network.

## Staking SLAs...

Our immediate collaboration will focus on adding support for **$AVAX Staking Agreements** to the [DSLA.network](http://dsla.network) flagship application. 

Successfully validating or delegating on Avalanche requires that [certain parameters are met](https://docs.avax.network/learn/platform-overview/staking#staking-parameters-on-avalanche)—a validator must be correct and online for 60% of the time to receive rewards, for example. If parameters like uptime percentages aren’t met, rewards are not distributed. Unlike existing blockchain platforms, Avalanche does not slash your stake.

When delegating on Avalanche, you’re relying on existing validators to stake your AVAX on your behalf (hence why users are subject to additional fees set by validators). Therefore for delegators, meeting these parameters are in the hands of third-party service providers.
DSLA provides a better way to manage exposure to third-party infrastructure risk.

When the monitored performance of a service (in this case, the ability for delegators to meet the Avalanche staking parameters) stays within the thresholds of an agreement, DSLA contract liquidity providers earn the right to claim a bonus from the agreement's liquidity pool. 
Conversely, when an agreement is violated because of the bad performance of a service, DSLA contract policyholders earn the right to claim compensation.

Soon after, DSLA Protocol will be deployed as smart contracts on the Avalanche network, serving the same purpose, but with built-in interoperability and scalability that are unique to Avalanche, hence the "Maxima" codename.


## ...And more

In the long term, the DSLA core development team will enable developers to add high-throughput, risk management and parametric insurance capabilities to their application built on Avalanche.

"As the Ethereum blockchain network increasingly struggles to satisfy the engineering requirements of developers, and is failing to bank the unbanked because of unsustainable fees, our team is convinced that an EVM-compatible blockchain like Avalanche has the potential to become a new, more scalable home for DeFi and the next generation of Solidity-based decentralized applications." said Wilhem Pujar, CEO at Stacktical and DSLA Protocol core developer.

## About Avalanche

Avalanche is an open-source platform for launching decentralized applications and enterprise blockchain deployments in one interoperable, highly scalable ecosystem. Avalanche is the first smart contracts platform that processes 4,500+ transactions/second and instantly confirms transactions. Ethereum developers can quickly build on Avalanche as Solidity works out-of-the-box.

## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Protocol, Oasis Edition](/assets/img/dsla-network_square-hand-shot-social_avalanche.png)](https://stacktical.com)

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables businesses to reduce their customers exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements and bonus-malus insurance policies.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).
