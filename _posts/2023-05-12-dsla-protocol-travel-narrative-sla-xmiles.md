## $xMILES

Today, DSLA core contributors are proud to introduce a new Consumer Protection instrument, that aims at offsetting bad travel experiences using cryptoeconomics: **Travel Service Level Agreements** or **Travel SLAs**. 

In order to bridge the gap between Travellers Rights and Third-Party Travel Risks, Travel SLAs work like candy machines for distributing **xMILES**, a synthetic digital asset **indexed on Third-Party Travel Analytics**. 

xMILES derive their value from the **periodic snapshot of travel analytics**, as orchestrated by the Travel SLA candy machine. 

Over the course of the year, DSLA core contributors will enable support for three metrics:

* Weather Conditions
* Delays & Cancellations
* Baggage Handling

Community-driven focus groups and improvement proposals will further extend the capabitilies of xMILES, so that more bad travel experiences can be mitigated. This is made possible by DSLA Protocol's **competitive moat.**



## Competitive Moat & Transformative Power

DSLA Protocol is a Peer-to-Peer Risk Management Infrastructure that has the ability to bring entirely new Consumer Protection instruments to market in 2 days, a dramatically faster Time to Market compared to historical Travel Industry stakeholders:

| Stakeholder         | Time to Market |                    Trust Setup |
| ------------------- | :------------: | -----------------------------: |
| Government          |   5-10 years   |                    Centralized |
| Insurance Companies |   2-5 years    |                    Centralized |
| Private Companies   |   2-5 years    |                    Centralized |
| **DSLA Protocol**   |   **2 days**   | **Minimised or Decentralized** |

Minting xMILES through Travel SLAs will effectively entitle you to a **warranty that your holidays will meet agreed-upon travel quality standards**.
