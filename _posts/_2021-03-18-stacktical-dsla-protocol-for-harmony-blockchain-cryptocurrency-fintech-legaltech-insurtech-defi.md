## DSLA Protocol for Harmony

DSLA Protocol enables anyone to add a service level agreement on top of any third-party service, to reduce customers exposure to infrastructure risks and incentivise the connectivity, performance and availability of services, networks and applications over time.

To bring our developer community access to more technologies, we are proud to announce that we have partnered with Harmony, to launch DSLA Maxima "Harmony Edition", a maximalist port of DSLA Protocol to the Harmony blockchain network.

Harmony $ONE staking is the 1st blockchain integration we announced for DSLA Protocol, a couple month ago. We've always had excellent relationship with the Harmony core team, and our other partners at P-OPS, one of the leading Harmony staking and delegation service providers. Today, we are strengthening One of the major challenges faced by blockchain networks is to balance the need for transparency as a community, with the need for privacy as individuals and organisations. 

Oasis Protocol built a great ecosystem to achieve just that, and empower decentralized use cases that require more nuanced ways to handle sensitive data and information.

> It increasingly became obvious, through our frequent discussions with bakers from around the world, that DSLA Protocol should focus on baking risk reduction at launch.

## Baking SLAs & Tezos Hedging Products

As [we recently announced](https://blog.stacktical.com/mainnet/2021/01/22/stacktical-dsla-protocol-itsm-sla-tezos-xtz-staking-baking-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-defi.html), our immediate collaboration with Nomadic Labs, core Tezos developers, will focus on adding support for **$XTZ Baking Agreements** to the [DSLA.network](http://dsla.network) flagship application. 

$XTZ Baking Agreements compensate $XTZ delegators for drops in $XTZ baking rewards, while rewarding $XTZ bakers for their ability to endorse and validate Tezos blocks.

Later this year, DSLA Protocol will be deployed as smart contracts on the Tezos network, serving the same purpose, but with a strong focus on the Tezos DeFi and NFT ecosystem, hence the "Maxima" codename.

Our Tezos-native edition of DSLA Protocol will enable developers to add risk management and parametric insurance capabilities to their applications built on Tezos.

## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Token, now on Argent wallet](/assets/img/2020-08-26-dsla-token-available-on-Argent-keyless-wallet-screenshot.jpg)](https://stacktical.com)

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements and bonus-malus insurance policies.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).
