### <i class="fas fa-chart-line"></i> Finance & Operations

#### Finance / Cryptocurrency Exchange Listing

| Task or Indicator        | Value |
| :------------- | :-------------|
| Pre-agreements (DEX) | **2 out of 3 objective(s)** |
| Pre-agreements (Centralized) | **2 out of 1 objective(s)** |

We are still actively reaching pre-agreements with both decentralized (D) and centralized (X) exchanges.

#### Finance / DSLA Supply Management

* In preparation for exchange listing, we plan on burning 1B DSLA tokens.

This will reduce the total supply from 10B to 9B DSLA.

#### Legal / Privacy Policy   

> How do you enforce the right to be forgotten in an immutable environment? 

It appears that an Ethereum wallet address can be a Personal Data as per GDPR's definitions. From the management of user consent to enforcing the right to be forgotten, the Stacktical Legal Team has led a series of workshop to ensure that the DSLA Network Platform that we are building complies with privacy and personal data custody practices.
