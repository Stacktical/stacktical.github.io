## There's a dapp for that ⚡️

DSLA Protocol's goal is to enable **anyone** to add a service level agreement on top of **any third-party service**, to reduce customers exposure to infrastructure risks and incentivise the connectivity, performance and availability of networks and applications over time.

To achieve that goal, we are partnering with leading corporations, network infrastructure providers, and developers around the world, to ensure that DSLA Protocol is available as a desktop and mobile software development kits, and fulfil its mission as a next-generation service governance vehicle.

But today though, the focus of the DSLA core development team is to de-risk cryptocurrency staking and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) experiences using DSLA contracts, their staking capabilities, and their parametric, bonus-malus insurance policies.

That is what [DSLA.network](https://dsla.network), our flagship Ðapp, is all about.

From our interactions with core teams in the space, DSLA could be implemented at the L1/L2 protocol level as a module, similar to the slashing module of Cosmos/Tendermint chains.

### Risk #1: Yield Drops

**Solution:** Staking Efficiency SLA

The Staking Efficiency metric is the percentage of realized rewards by a given Validator. A Staking Efficiency DSLA contract provides you with a hedge against staking efficiency drops.

### Risk #2: Payment & Withdrawal Delays

**Solution:** Processing Time SLA

A Time to Payout DSLA contract provides you with a hedge against late staking rewards payouts.

### Risk #3: Impermanent Loss

**Solution:** Processing Time SLA

## About DSLA Protocol
![DSLA Protocol, Elrond Edition](/assets/img/dsla-network_square-hand-shot-social_elrond.png)

As users outsource increasingly more functions of their lives and businesses to third-party service providers, they need better ways to manage their exposure to third-party infrastructure risk. Especially when money is at stake.

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that gives anyone the ability to create, monitor and execute decentralized service level agreements and parametric insurance policies.

When the monitored performance of a service is within the thresholds of an agreement, third-party service providers and liquidity providers earn the right to claim a reward from the agreement liquidity pool. Conversely, when an agreement is violated, customers earn the right to claim a compensation. 

Win-Win.
