## Focusing on a new series of listing

To prepare DSLA for the **[next steps of its development](https://blog.stacktical.com/reporting/2019/12/16/stacktical-dsla-token-listing-roadmap.html)** for 2020, the DSLA/ETH pair has stopped trading on the **[P2PB2B](https://p2pb2b.io)** exchange, effective immediately.  

We invite all DSLA holders to withdraw their DSLA tokens from P2PB2B, and use the **[STEX cryptocurrency exchange](https://app.stex.com/en/trade/pair/ETH/DSLA)** to acquire DSLA tokens from now on.  

## Withdraw everything before Feb 18th, 2020
**Withdrawals will not be possible after Feb 18th, 2020**.  
Please make sure you proceed as soon as you can, to avoid losing your tokens.


## About DSLA Protocol

[DSLA Protocol](https://stacktical.com) is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

DSLA Protocol's flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of Proof-of-Stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the connectivity, performance and availability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers.
