## Changing how we tell stories

One of last year's main objectives was to develop our ability to produce a continuous stream of quality content about the Stacktical ecosystem. Between predicting the scalability of applications using mathematical models, reinventing customer service using service level agreements on the Blockchain and conveying the thrills of our token sale, there were tons of experiences and information to share with our *[growing community](https://t.me/stacktical){:target="_blank"}*. 

Blogging on *[Medium.com](https://medium.com/stacktical){:target="_blank"}* has enabled us to keep you in the loop, often through rendez-vous like our weekly status update. However, in order to ensure your ability to freely consume Stacktical content, we felt it was important to re-claim ownership of our publications and embrace a more open alternative as our main communication channel.

Moving forward, and while we will keep publishing stories on Medium (for the time being), the official Stacktical Blog at *[blog.stacktical.com](https://blog.stacktical.com){:target="_blank"}* will your main destination for product, market and corporate news about the Stacktical ecosystem. 

Content-wise, my wish for this new year of operations is to *double down on blogging while venturing into new, multimedia grounds.* Understand more posts more often, podcasts and video. We will make sure to update you about our new initiatives very soon. For now, you might as well join our *[BlockOps Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Stacktical/){:target="_blank"}* group, it will play an key role in  future media productions.
