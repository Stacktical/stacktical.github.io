## Risk Management Middleware

DSLA Protocol v2.0 will introduce DSLA Triggers, powerfully extending DSLA's Risk Management Middleware capabilities beyond just compensation and economic claim settlement. Developers will be able to easily plug in risk management capabilities to their dApps, using service level agreements (SLA) to monitor external risks and respond by trigger actions including:
* Compensations âœ…
* Terminations âœ…
* Notifications âœ…
* Amendments âœ…

### DSLA Triggered DevOps

We're familiar with using DSLA Protocol to trigger *compensations* and manage risk using SLAs, similar to an insurance product. Now with DSLA Triggers we have a plug-and-play option to integrate other types of risk awareness and response into dApps. Monitor external data or analytics that may affect operations and automatically trigger an appropriate response.

That's a bit abstract, so let's look at the trigger types and define what sort of operational change those triggers might prompt:

**Compensations:** Our original trigger. Used to integrate insurance-like risk management where compensation or rewards are triggered based on whether a service meets performance targets. Compensations can also be extended beyond the traditional "service" to any measurable, available data. Think triggering compensations based on weather for vacation rentals or earnings performance for a public company.

**Terminations:** Terminate an agreement, close an account, close out a positon or remove liquidity based on external data. For instance, monitor the supply of a token, if supply grows beyond the expected rate (ie. a likely minting exploit has occurred) trigger circuit breaker actions to halt transfers and remove liquidity from exchanges until funds are confirmed **safu**.

**Notifications:** Automate notifications and reporting based on changes that may affect operations such as third party service performance degredation, price changes, collateral backing status or any of an almost endless number of measurable data points or external analytics. For example get notified, if you are [7-siblings and your $600m MakerDAO vault is at risk of being liquidated](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/25/ethereum-money-markets-see-record-liquidations-as-ether-tanks-makerdao-revenue-surges/).

**Amendments:** Amend or update DevOps parameters like insurance premiums, staking fees, rental rates, pool yields or collateral factors. Make automatic, efficient and transparent changes based on external data or analytics that affect your operation.

DSLA Triggers will enable developers to efficiently setup a system with a automated, rich and complex risk management architecture using multiple Trigger types.

Let's look at a hypothetical case where a City implements a green governance initiative for air quality monitoring. Using DSLA Risk Management Middleware you could easily trigger any or all of the following based on air quality measurements:

* Local industrial emitters sign on to commit to a an air quality target, a service level objective (SLO), backing it with a funded SLA
* The City and/or area residents can sign onto the SLA, receiving compensation if air quality breaches the target; emmitters are rewarded for meeting air quality targets
* Air quality is monitored and notifications are sent out to companies nearing their target threshold. Automatic compliance reports are sent out based on performanc and notifications are sent out on the five best and five worst performing emitters.
* Participating companies are designated a status (ie. Air Quality Ally) based on performance. Good standing status is suspended, terminated or reinstated based on air quality data. Automated through DSLA Risk Management Middleware, company status' will always be current and assigned in a way that is efficient, secure, objective and transparent.
* If air quality falls beyond a certain threshold, an amendment is triggered to add a surcharge for City provided services like waste disposal or water/wastewater. Surcharge funds are used in further air quality improvement initiatives.

### Risk Management for Any Data or Analytics

External data and analytics that could be monitored by DSLA Risk Management Middleware to trigger actions based on many, many different factors:

* Overall crypto market upside/downside
* Overall stock market upside/downside
* Prime interest rate changes
* Consumer Price Index (CPI) changes
* Utility costs
* Weather
* Monitored Air Quality changes
* Net cash inflows or outflows for a specific market
* Average home sale price in an area

Really the only limit becomes your imagination and confirming the availability of the data or analytics you need.
