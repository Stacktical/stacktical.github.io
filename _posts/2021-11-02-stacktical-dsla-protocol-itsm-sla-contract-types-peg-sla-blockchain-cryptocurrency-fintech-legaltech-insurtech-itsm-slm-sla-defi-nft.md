## Use DSLA to hedge against pegged assets losing their peg

The DSLA core team is proud to announce that we will be adding **Loss of Peg Risk Agreements** as a new supported type of agreement in DSLA Protocol!

Let's dig a little deeper into pegged assets, the risks associated with them and how DSLA Protocol will help.

### What are pegged assets?

Pegged assets refer to a class of crypto assets that are intended to have their value stay matched, or **pegged**, to the value of an underlying asset. These underlying assets can be a fiat currency such as USD, a commodity like gold, another cryptocurrency such as BTC or a stock such as TESLA, just to name a few.

The method for ensuring the peg is maintained can vary. Some pegged assets are backed and redeemable for the actual underlying asset. Other pegged assets are collateralized or partially collateralized by other crypto assets and use different algorithms to incentivize the peg to be maintained.

### Losing peg

There are risks that the methods and algorithms designed to maintain the peg value falter or fail, resulting in the price of the pegged asset becoming untethered from the price of the underlying asset.  

This depegging can result in losses for anyone holding the asset. Consider for example if Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) suddenly lost peg and was worth 20% less than the Bitcoin it represents, or if the DAI stablecoin could not maintain a value close to it's $1 USD target. If either of those assets **lost peg** the individuals holding them, and relying on the peg being maintained, would potentially be out that value.

|**RISK&nbsp;APPRAISAL**| |
|---------------------|----------|
| Risk Type        | Depeg Risk |
| Risk Description | Crypto asset price becomes untethered from underlying asset price | 
| Assets at Risk   | Stablecoins, Synthetic Assets |
| Value at Risk    | > \$100b |

## DSLA Protocol fixes this

The **Loss of Peg Risk SLA** will enable holders of pegged assets such as stETH ([lido.fi](https://lido.fi)), algorithmic stablecoins, and other pegged synthetic assets to offset the risk of those assets losing peg, receiving compensation in event of a loss of peg.

On the flip side, **Loss of Peg Risk SLAs** will allow for core teams, investor groups, or individuals who are confident that the respective protocol will maintain it's peg to back it and profit when it does.

> Holders of a pegged asset use DSLA Protocol to trade the risk of depegging away to a counterparty, in exchange for a small premium. The counterparty profits from that premium, if the peg is maintained.

### How it will work 

To activate an agreement, both parties need to fund their position by staking one of the many supported currencies (as updated [here!](2021-10-28-stacktical-dsla-protocol-stablecoins-native-tokens-liquid-staking-october-2021-blockchain-cryptocurrency-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-itsm-slm-sla-defi-nft.md)) to the DSLA contract liquidity pool.

While a **Loss of Peg Risk SLA** is active, DSLA Protocol monitors the price of the pegged asset and the underlying asset (ie. the price of stETH and the price of ETH); periodic verifications of the prices are done at the interval noted in the contract.

If the difference between the pegged asset price and the underlying asset price stays within the thresholds of the agreement, DSLA Liquidity Providers earn the right to claim a reward, by depleting premiums paid by the pegged asset holders who signed onto the DSLA contract.

Conversely, if an agreement is violated, Pegged Asset Holders earn the right to claim a compensation, by depleting the upfront commitment of DSLA Liquidity Providers.

### Sounds complicated

There is a lot to digest understanding DSLA Protocol and how DSLA Contracts work. If this all seems a bit like watching a movie in a foreign language with no subtitles, don't worry!
