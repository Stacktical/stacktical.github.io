## En route to CMC

*Edit (2020/07/21): DSLA/USDT debuts trading on [Bilaxy](https://bilaxy.com/trade/DSLA_USDT)*

We have updated our [DSLA token listing roadmap](https://blog.stacktical.com/reporting/2019/12/16/stacktical-dsla-token-listing-roadmap.html) to integrate a third bridge listing! This will allow DSLA to be eligible for circulating supply and market cap tracking on CoinMarketCap, a major step towards the global adoption of the project:

| Phase        | Description           | ETA           | DSLA Protocol Network Maturity | Status           | Exchange 
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |

ETA for listing DSLA on this new Bridge 3 exchange is **July 2020 - August 2020 (but probably sooner than you think).**

Until then, we strongly advise that you acquire DSLA on [ProBit](https://www.probit.com/app/exchange/DSLA-USDT) now, as we are gearing up for surprise announcements.

## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Token, now on Argent wallet](/assets/img/2020-08-26-dsla-token-available-on-Argent-keyless-wallet-screenshot.jpg)](https://stacktical.com)

[DSLA Protocol](https://stacktical.com) is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

DSLA Protocol's flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of Proof-of-Stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the connectivity, performance and availability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers.
