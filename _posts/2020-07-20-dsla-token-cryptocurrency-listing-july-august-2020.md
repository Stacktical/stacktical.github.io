## En route to CMC

We have updated our [DSLA token listing roadmap](https://blog.stacktical.com/reporting/2019/12/16/stacktical-dsla-token-listing-roadmap.html) to integrate a third bridge listing! This will allow DSLA to be eligible for circulating supply and market cap tracking on CoinMarketCap, a major step towards the global adoption of the project:

| Phase        | Description           | ETA           | DSLA Protocol Network Maturity | Status           | Exchange 
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| 0 | Token Generation Event| Q3 2018 | **Genesis** of the DSLA Protocol | **Done** | **N/A**
| 1 | Initial Listing | Q3 2019 | **Alpha** available on the Ethereum **Test** Network | **Done** | P2PB2B
| 2 | Bridge 1 | Q1 2020 | **Beta** available on the Ethereum **Test** Network  | **Done** | [STEX](https://app.stex.com/en/trade/pair/ETH/DSLA/1)
| 3 | Bridge 2 | Q2 2020 | **Release Candidate** available on the Ethereum **Main** Network  | **Done** | [ProBit](https://www.probit.com/app/exchange/DSLA-USDT)
| 4 | Bridge 3 | Q2 2020 | **Release Candidate** available on the Ethereum **Main** Network  | In progress | In progress

ETA for listing DSLA on this new Bridge 3 exchange is **July 2020 - August 2020 (but probably sooner than you think).**

Until then, we strongly advise that you acquire DSLA on [ProBit](https://www.probit.com/app/exchange/DSLA-USDT) now, as we are gearing up for surprise announcements.
