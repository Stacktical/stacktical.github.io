## The DSLA Residency Program is Live! 🧑‍💻

The DSLA Residency Program is an initiative to encourage open contribution from our global community of DSLA Champs. 

The DSLA Residency provides an avenue for valuable feedback to the core team and will also provide opportunities for Residents to give input on DSLA Protocol, acting as a DAO testbed.

The core team will post tasks on the [Residency Github](https://github.com/Stacktical/stacktical-dsla-residency) for interested community members to review and undertake. Completing one of these tasks will entitle DSLA Residents to a DSLA bounty!

We'll also be asking Residents for feedback on various DSLA Protocol related initiatives to help guide our efforts!

## What are we looking for?

There are several categories where we would like to see Residency input:

📈 Marketing

👩‍💻 Development

🧪 Protocol Design

👨‍💻 DevSecOps

🪶 Technical Writing

⚙️ Developer Advocacy

Check out the [Residency Github](https://github.com/Stacktical/stacktical-dsla-residency) and review the open issues under the [Residency Github Issues](https://github.com/Stacktical/stacktical-dsla-residency/issues).

If you feel there are tasks you may be able to help with:

**Step 1: Pick a task**

**Step 2: Contact us**

**Step 4: Complete your task**

Congratulations on contributing to DSLA! 🎉

Completed tasks will be reflected in this repository.

## Open to Residency Ideas! 💡

If you have a great idea for something that can be done in one of the categories listed above, but it's not currently listed as an open issue in the [Residency Github](https://github.com/Stacktical/stacktical-dsla-residency), please let us know! We are happy to consider other ideas for tasks that add value to DSLA Protocol or the DSLA family of products!

## **Developers**, This Includes You!

We think the DSLA Residency is a great opportunity for developers to contribute to DSLA Protocol at their own pace and be rewarded for their efforts.

If that interests you, check out the [DSLA Protocol Developer Toolkit (DTK)](https://github.com/Stacktical/stacktical-dsla-developer-toolkit) and the [DSLA Protocol Developer Guide](https://readme.stacktical.com/developer-guide/) to get started.

If you think there's a contribution you can make, let us know!
