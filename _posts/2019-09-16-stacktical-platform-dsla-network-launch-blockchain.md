# The Stacktical SLA Platform is Up and Running

Our team is very proud to announce that, after months of customer surveys, community feedbacks and software development, we have successfully released the first version of the Stacktical Decentralized Service Governance platform at **[https://dsla.network](https://dsla.network)** ! ðŸŽ‰

We would like to sincerely thank our friends, family and other token sale contributors for making the development of this platform possible. A little more than 2 years after bootstrapping our company, the Stacktical Platform is now ideally positionned to shape the future of service delivery and customer support, using decentralized service level agreement and the **[DSLA](https://p2pb2b.io/trade/DSLA_ETH)** cryptocurrency service credit.

Now let's dive a bit more into the two star features of this release. 

## Instant, Permissionless SLA Smart Contract Roll-out

When it comes down to aligning the risk of downtime with the ability to engineer uptime, SLAs have been around for quite some time. But as a legal answer to an infrastructure problem, SLAs struggle to keep with the speed of onboarding and supporting swarm of customers. Agreements end up being very generic, and fail to fulfill their original mission of driving better customer acquisition and retention for providers while offering guarantees that customers can trust.

Stacktical is the world's first platform to enable anyone to roll-out a service level agreement within minutes, on the Ethereum blockchain. 

Out of the box, Stacktical is compatible with just about any service connected to the Internet, for which uptime can be monitored.
