## Using DSLA to Manage Risk when the Sky is Falling ☂️

2021 has seen **a lot** of volatility.

Crypto markets **crashed** in May, recovered to new highs in November and crashed again in December. After a long run of 'up only' the stock market is now **showing weakness** as well. **Inflation**, a fear throughout the COVID-19 pandemic with supply chain challenges and governments printing record amounts of fiat currency, has started to have a **significant impact** on the cost of living.

It is safe to say that there is a lot of macroeconomic uncertainty at the moment, and that inflation fears are top of mind. Cryptocurrencies have long been billed as a 'hedge against inflation,' but this is based more on the fact that most cryptocurrencies cannot be modified to have runaway supply growth, such as we see with central bank fiat currencies these days, than providing a true hedge or risk management capability.

Until now there has not been any blockchain-based product to tangibly address real world inflation. Enter DSLA Protocol.

### Inflation Protection and More 🛡️

Inflation protection is possible with DSLA Protocol, leveraging the power of [Chainlink](https://chain.link) oracles and [Oasis Protocol](https://oasisprotocol.org) for privacy-enabled authenticated calls to consumer price index (CPI) data feeds.

With this powerful tech stack we can de-risk macro markets as well as any priced asset, product or service by tapping into a virtually unlimited number of data sources.

Inflation risk can be hedged using oraclized CPI data from services such as Bloomberg, Nasdaq or Nikkei. Overall market downside risks could be managed using data from CoinGecko or CoinMarketCap for crypto markets, or from stock indicies such as the S&P500, FTSE100 or NASDAQ for the broader stock market.

Where things start get even more interesting for 2022 is where we can take this with **DSLA Triggers**.

### DSLA Triggers 📡

One of the key differentiators for 2022 is the introduction of **DSLA Triggers**. DSLA Protocol, powered by [Chainlink](https://chain.link) and [Oasis Protocol](https://oasisprotocol.org), will now support not only crypto payouts, but triggering other activities based on SLA outcomes.

By now we are familiar with the current DSLA Protocol flow, where a crypto payout for a compensation or reward is triggered depending on the outcome of a service level indicator (SLI) verification. That payment is instantly available for the entitled party to claim. **DSLA Triggers** will allow other actions to be triggered based on the results of a SLI verification.

You can have SLA's for staking delegation uptime performance; for CPI inflation deviations from a set target rate; for Utility service cost deviations from a set target; or for Central Bank Prime interest rate changes -- to name just a few. Based on the outcome of your weekly or monthly SLI verifications, any of the following could be triggered:
* Compensation
  - Relief upon breach of performance
  - Reward upon metting performance metrics
* Amendment
  - Increase/Decrease insurance premiums
  - Increase/Decrease staking fees
  - Inflation-driven Yield Pricing
  - Month over Month rental rates
* Termination
  - Robotic Process Automation (RPA)* contract termination
* Migration
  - RPA contract migration

> robotic process automation (RPA) technology is used to automate simple repetitive back-office type tasks. RPA actions can be initiated as a result of some real world change, called by a DSLA Trigger, to make changes to a company policy, service rate or other data point that is directly impacted by external factors. ie. A landlord may need to raise rental rates if the cost of utilities increases beyond planned seasonal fluctuations.

These are a few examples of the almost endless possibilities with this functionality. Needless to say we are extremely excited about this development and can't wait to get it launched with our friends from [Chainlink](https://chain.link) and [Oasis Protocol](https://oasisprotocol.org)!
