## Meet BonzAI, the new product of the DSLA family

On top of the architectural, participation requirements and tokenomics changes highlighted in [our previous article](https://blog.stacktical.com/mainnet/2024/02/27/dsla-protocol-v3.html), DSLA v3.0 represents a major shift in how we approach Risk Management using Artificial Intelligence.

In order to **deliver Insurance as Code**, DSLA v3.0 plans to go beyond and above traditional user experiences, and rely on AI prompts and intents to develop, issue, sign and enforce service level agreements.

**From a technological standpoint, this means DSLA v3.0 needs a component that allows us to train, execute and distribute our own AI models.** 

Instead of burrying this technology in the existing and upcoming architecture of DSLA, we decided to unbundle it into a standalone protocol, that will help developers achieve the same goal of orchestrating the deployment of their own Artificial Intelligence stack.

**Our team is proud to introduce BonzAI, a tool that enables the one-click deployment of your [#AI](https://twitter.com/hashtag/AI?src=hashtag_click) models to your computer, self-hosted infrastructure and Bittensor [$TAO](https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TAO&src=cashtag_click) subnet!** 

> BonzAI is in the pure tradition of the products built at Stacktical, and a meaningful addition to our offering, with its own potential as a standalone protocol. It's also an excellent mean to do right by our community, that supported our efforts for the past 5+ years.

Welcome to the future of decentralized, privacy-preserving Artificial Intelligence that you own, forever.

## The pilars of the BonzAI DePIN protocol

Supported by the BONZAI utility token, BonzAI is a DePin protocol that allows anyone to deploy their own AI for their personal and professional needs.

In practice, this means you will achieve:

* **1-click local deployment** of open source AI models to your own computer

e.g. Your own ChatGPT experience, trained to your liking, with full respect of your privacy and data ownership

* **1-click remote deployment** of open source AI models to remote, self-hosted environments

e.g. The backend of your AI startup, at a fraction of the cost of third-party AI API services such as OpenAI

* **1-click blockchain deployment to Bittensor Subnet** and of all its requirements

e.g. The backend of your blockchain AI protocol and the easiest way to join Bittensor



## BONZAI airdrop to DSLA utility tokens supporters

Hello, world BONZAI !  



The **BONZAI utility token** has been successfully deployed to: 

1/ The [@ethereum](https://twitter.com/ethereum) network at [https://etherscan.io/token/0xdda9ff241c7160be8295ef9eca2e782361467666â€¦](https://t.co/6DrY42Jeyi) 

2/ The [@arbitrum](https://twitter.com/arbitrum) network at [https://arbiscan.io/token/0x0a84edf70f30325151631ce7a61307d1f4d619a3â€¦](https://t.co/DpTdP0yHQS)



### Tokenomics & Allocations

BONZAI has a total supply of 21M, a current circulating supply of 14M, and plans on reaching at least 80% circulation within the next two months.

The allocation stands as follow:

* **Community Airdrop**: 23% of the total supply (4.83M BONZAI)

* **Decentralized Exchanges**: 33% of the total supply (7M BONZAI)

* **Foundation**: 10% of the total supply (2.1M BONZAI)

* **Investors & Team **: 33% of the total supply (7M BONZAI)



**Following this initial allocation, the FDV (Fully Diluted Value) of BONZAI starts at roughly 2.1M USD, with a current price of 0.00003 ETH per BONZAI (0,1 USD, at the time of writing).**



### Airdrop Information & KuCoin Volume Support

DSLA utility tokens holders will receive BONZAI proportionnally to their DSLA utility tokens holdings, across all supported blockchain networks and DSLA utility tokens v2.0 Parametric Staking pools.

**The goal of the airdrop is to seed the BonzAI protocol in a way that benefits DSLA utility tokens holders, and support the existing volume of DSLA utility tokens on KuCoin with organic volume generated by airdrop participants.**

BONZAI is a perfect opportunity for DSLA and its community to demonstrate their resilience, and the renewed potential of our Risk Management vision powered by BonzAI's Artificial Intelligence deployments.
