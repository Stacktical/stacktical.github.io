## It's started

Dear community, the core development team of DSLA Protocol is pleased to announce that we have initiated our mainnet deployment operations earlier today.

Provided our team does not run into any blocking issues, the DSLA Protocol v1 availability should span across March 31 and April 1, depending on your timezone.

DSLA Protocol being a large-scale initiative that involves multiple partnering blockchain networks and external service providers, DSLA contract types and supported third-party services will be rolled out progressively, according to their own roadmap detailed below.

As hinted on numerous occasions, Harmony will be the first officially supported network of DSLA Protocol, and a key area of focus for our team.

## Audit Status

Let's talk security now.

### Completed

At this stage, along with our comprehensive internal testing, we have received two full security audits of the DSLA Protocol:  

* An audit from leading german security firm [Chainsulting](https://chainsulting.de/)
* An audit from an independant white hat security expert and member of the Hackerone community

**All high and critical issues raised during this double audit have been addressed.**

The aforementioned security auditors are in the process of wrapping up their respective reports. We will share them with the community, and attach them to official DSLA Protocol smart contract on Etherscan, as soon as they are available.

### In Progress

[CertiK](https://certik.foundation/)'s security audit, focusing on DSLA Protocol smart contract handling funds, is still in progress. 

Should unforeseen issues be surfaced by CertiK after our mainnet launch, appropriate steps will be taken to circumvent them, most likely through a v1.1 redeployment of the entire protocol and associated guidelines.

It is an important technical tradeoff to potentially proceed with such redeployment, but we felt having non-upgradeable smart contracts to be more aligned with our community's interests, by principle of decentralization.

### Secure Rollout

In that spirit, and while obtaining two successful audits give us the confidence to release DSLA Protocol as planned, we will initially mark this mainnet release as experimental.

Specifically, we will put temporary limitations in place to further secure the launch during a **10-days grace period**.

In addition to this secure rollout, we encourage white hats to keep submitting their findings using the **[security bounty campaign](https://immunefi.com/bounty/dslaprotocol/)** we put in place with our friends at Immunefi.

### 10-days Grace Period

Details about the mainnet grace period will be shared in a dedicated post at launch. 

In the meantime, here are some of the general principles that will apply:
* DSLA will be the only currency available for staking
* Staking will be temporary capped to smaller amounts
* Only ONE Staking Agreements will be available

## Key Staking Dates

### Genesis SLA Period

**The genesis DSLA period will start on April 5 00:00 UTC and end on April 11 23:59:59 UTC.**

All ONE Staking Agreements created before April 5 will be elligible for the genesis SLA period, and for the first batch of SLA staking rewards.

### Genesis SLA Staking Rewards

**The first staking rewards claim will be available on April 12**, after the end of the genesis SLA period.

## Integration Roadmap

We will be focusing on 4 network integrations in the next two months.

| Use Case        | Network           | Service           | ETA           | Status
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |  :------------- | 
| APR Agreements | Harmony | $ONE Staking & Delegation | Mar 31| Done
| APR Agreements | Avalanche | $AVAX Staking & Delegation | Apr 21 | Done
| APR Agreements | Polkadot | $DOT Staking & Delegation | May 12 | In Progress
| APR Agreements | Cosmos | $ATOM Staking & Delegation | Jun 2 | Coming Soon

Details about Impermanent Loss Agreements will be shared in a future update.

## Outro

The DSLA Protocol mainnet is the start of a long journey to product-market fit.

We strongly believe in the benefits of a slightly more controlled launch that what you might be used to, that accounts for the engineering challenges ahead of us.

**D-1!**

## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Protocol](/assets/img/dsla-network_device-duo-stacked.jpg)](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xd0fbb87e47da9987d345dbdf3a34d4266cf5ebe9)

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables developers and infrastructure operators to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).
