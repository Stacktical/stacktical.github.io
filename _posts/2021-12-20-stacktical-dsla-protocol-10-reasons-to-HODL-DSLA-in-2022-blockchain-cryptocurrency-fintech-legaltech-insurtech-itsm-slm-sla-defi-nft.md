## 2021 Recap: Building a Solid Foundation üß±

2021 was an amazing year for DSLA Protocol! We're so proud of what we've accomplished and even more excited for what is to come in 2022. Let's recap some of the major milestones hit in 2021:

* The launch of DSLA Protocol v1.0 (with myriad improvements up to the current v1.7.x)
* Integration of 10+ tokens with DSLA Protocol for use in SLA contracts
* DSLA expands and goes live on six different networks (Ethereum, Harmony, Polygon, Avalanche, Fantom, Binance Smart Chain)
* The launch of the [dsla.network](https://dsla.network) dApp
* DSLA's Developer Toolkit (DTK) is released (and used to build a working use case!)
* Our first #DubaiDeFi Hackathon
* Partnership with Gartner
* Integration with [request.network](https://request.network)

The groundwork laid in 2021 set DSLA Protocol up for success going into 2022.

## 10 Reasons to HODL in 2022: Innovation, Growth and Scaling üå±

As we've noted before, 2021 was the year we laid the foundation, while 2022 is the year for DSLA Protocol to scale. Without further adieu, here are 10 reasons to HODL DSLA in 2022!

### 1. Subnet Launchpad

Avalanche subnets are one of the most exciting developments for blockchain scalability in the web3 space. To deploy a subnet on Avalanche, though, you need to attract and incentivize validators to validate and secure it. This presents a two-pronged challenge for anyone who wants to deploy a subnet:
* How can you effectively attract and incentivize validators?
* How can you easily manage this process, and ensure the validators you do attract meet a minimum desired standard for uptime and responsiveness?

As announced in our [blog post](https://blog.stacktical.com/mainnet/roadmap/2021/12/17/stacktical-dsla-protocol-2022-roadmap-avalanche-subnet-launchpad-blockchain-cryptocurrency-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-itsm-slm-sla-defi-nft.html), DSLA will be deploying a Subnet Launchpad product, leveraging DSLA Protocol technology to help streamline this process!

This is base functionality already built into DSLA Protocol. Subnet launchoooors will be able to use DSLA's launchpad to **attract validators** to their subnet and **incentivize them to maintain predefined performance targets**.

### 2. DSLA Academy and Metaverse

The DSLA Academy and Metaverse will provide an interactive learning experience to help onboard more people to DSLA Protocol, from beginners to advanced users to developers. Helping people understand the benefits of DSLA Protocol, how it works and how to get started with an experience that is powered by DSLA NFTs will make DSLA Protocol more accessible.

NFT's in the Academy and Metaverse will be minted using DSLA tokens, with a portion burned and a portion used for incentivization. Additionally, some of the NFT's earned will be able to be staked for Protocol benefits such as increased returns. The Academy and Metaverse will introduce for incentivized, protocol-based NFT's with true functionality.

### 3. DSLA MetaFi

The Metaverse was one of the big themes in crypto in 2021 and will continue to be as the space matures and evolves through 2022. 

MetaFi, the integration of decentralized financial tools that will power the financial aspect of The Metaverse, has the potential to be massive. DSLA Protocol, as a risk management middleware, is uniquely positioned to empower open and permissionless risk management in the open and permissionless Metaverse.

In addition there will be a direct MetaFi aspect to the DSLA Academy and Metaverse, with some DSLA NFT's having MetaFi functionality within the DSLA ecosystem as noted above.

### 4. Deflationary

Let it burn!üî•

DSLA Protocol is designed to be deflationary, with a portion of all verification fees being burned. As additional use cases are deployed, and adoption across all use cases goes up, DSLA burned through verifications will ramp up.

2022 will see several other catalysts stoking this deflationary fire:
* DSLA Metaverse NFT's will be minted using DSLA tokens, with a portion burned.
* DSLA Protocol v2.0 will charge a claiming fee for withdrawing earned / accrued liquidity from a SLA, with a portion of the fee burned.
* DSLA Protocol v2.0 will introduce Triggers and Trigger Fees, with a portion of the fee burned.

### 5. DTK + Developers

The Developer Toolkit (DTK) was released in Q4 of 2021 to empower developers to build new use cases, plugging DSLA Protocol risk management middleware into their own applications. Shortly thereafter it was put through a real world trial in the [#DubaiDeFi](https://dubaidefi.io) hackathon and successfully used to build a number of new use cases.

One of the things we're most excited about for 2022 is seeing developers leverage DSLA's risk management middleware to create new and novel use cases or plug native risk management capabilities into their existing dApps!

### 6. Additional Use Cases

The DSLA Core Team plans to roll out a few new SLA types in the near term including:

* Peg SLA's for stablecoins and synthetic assets
* Impermanent Loss SLA's for liquidity providers

Of course, this isn't all that is in store for new use cases, we're working on several other SLA's, with one coming very soon that is extremely relevant with current macroeconomic concerns! Stay tuned for more new use case developments through 2022!

### 7. DSLA v2.0

DSLA v2.0 is coming in 2022.ü•≥

DSLA v1.0 built a solid foundation for the protocol to build on and grow from. DSLA v2.0 has a lot of goodies coming, and while we're not ready to spill the beans quite yet on everything, here are a few things you can expect:
* DeFi composability - SLA contract vaults compound, increasing capital efficiency
* DSLA triggers - Support for SLI outcomes to trigger other actions beyond simple crypto transfers
* UI/UX improvements - Numerous improvements to streamline and improve protocol interaction for mass use

2022 is shaping up to see a lot of focus on blockchain infrastructure projects. DSLA Protocol risk managment middleware, with the upgrades coming in v2.0, can become the backbone for DeFi risk management infrastructure.

### 8. Solo Staking

DSLA solo staking will be supported in 2022, enabling holders to earn a return on their DSLA tokens with no risk of impermanent loss.üí∞

### 9. DSLA No Code

DSLA No Code Tools will be a step change in accessibility and functionality. It will enable anyone to build a custom SLA risk swap in just a few clicks. When you combine this with DSLA Triggers and other features coming in v2.0, you create the first decentralized, accessible, configurable risk mitigation tool in history.

We're getting goosebumps thinking of how this all stacks up: DSLA no code tools opening up mass accessibility and innovation * Real world use cases and integrations * MetaFi and the huge market provided by the financialization of everything in the Metaverse.

The possibilities are limitless. 

### 10. Tezos integration

Last, but certainly not least, Tezos integration opens up DSLA to another blockchain network with a robust and growing DeFi and MetaFi ecosystem. Tezos has been a leader at onboarding institutions, most notably in Europe, and we expect big things in 2022.

Rolling out DSLA Protocol risk management middleware on Tezos will allow us to offer decentralized risk management capabilities to they type of customers who will *require* it -- institutions just dipping their toes into the crypto pool for the first time!
