## The Problem with Staking ðŸ“‰

One of the biggest risks users face when staking crypto is the volatility and price movement of the asset they are staking. General volatility isn't the only issue, either.

**Most DeFi staking programs have a dirty little secret.**

They are flawed. They way they are setup generally *encourages* stakers to dump their returns, putting constant selling pressure on the token.

Some staking programs try to mitigate this by requiring users to lock their stake for a certain time period, like 30 or 60 days. By itself, this lockup strategy usually doesn't work that well. It could even be argued that it makes the issue worse, by compelling stakers to dump all rewards to mitigate potential price drops.

The end result is that often in DeFi, stakers don't come out ahead. The ones who do are those in first, who get the super-high APR returns before more people join the staking pool and generate ever more selling pressure.

## Enter Parametric Staking ðŸ“ˆ

Parametric Staking, powered by DSLA GRC Automation Middleware, is performance-based staking that changes the equation, providing an incentive to HODL staking rewards.

So how does it work?

First we choose a parameter to base the staking on. In our example we'll use **Token Price**, but you could use many different parameters, depending on what you are trying to accomplish with your Parametric Staking program.

Now, using **Token Price** as our parameter, we think of Parametric Staking like a Staking Upside Service Level Agreement (SLA), where you are hedging *against* the upside of staked assets. So you are hedging against the risk of the price going up. Like any hedge, if what you are hedging against happens, you make a return.

> With Parametric Staking based on Token Price, if the token price goes up, the staking APR also goes up and stakers earn more rewards.

In the simplest terms possible: **Number go up means number go up ðŸ˜Š.**

In our example we used token price as the measured parameter, but you could use any measurable input that relates to your token. A few possible examples:
* **Token Price** - to offset staking returns price pressure
* **Holder Count** - to encourage an increase in holders
* **Tokens Locked in Protocol Pools** - to encourage certain types of token or protocol usage (even cross-protocol adoption)
* **Month-over-Month Growth Metrics** - to reward protocol growth

Parametric Staking will allow projects to make their staking more targeted and effective. It also becomes a somewhat self-governing program, where more tokens are spent as rewards if the staking program is having the desired effect and less tokens are spent as rewards if it is not.

This is a sharp contrast to other staking regimes where protocols set a rewards pool, get the word out to maximize participation, but overall just hope for the best.

## Staking Service Credits ðŸª™

One other benefit to Parametric Staking is the Service Credits that stakers will receive. As with any SLA, users who deposit stakes to the SLA receive Branded Service Credits back to represent their SLA position. 

So while the initial tokens deposited are locked, Service Credits are a liquid, tradeable token that derive their value from the performance of the underlying token. This opens up new and novel trading opportunities for users who have locked stakes.

## Ready to Shake Up the Staking Landscape ðŸŒ‹

DSLA's Parametric Staking is made possible by leveraging our SLA 3.0 technology and just goes to show how flexible and powerful DSLA Protocol is as an Automation Middleware.

We're excited to roll this out for our global community of DSLA Champs first, and then see it grow as other protocols adopt the superior solution that Parametric Staking represents.
