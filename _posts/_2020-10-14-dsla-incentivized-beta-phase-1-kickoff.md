## About DSLA Protocol

![DSLA Protocol](https://storage.googleapis.com/stacktical-public/dsla-protocol_by_stacktical.png) 

DSLA Protocol is a decentralized alternative to service level agreements, contracts that reduce your exposure to delays and disruptions, when using a service.

It enables anyone to vouch for the reliability of a service, earn rewards when the service performs as expected, and claim financial compensation when the service doesn’t meet expectations.
