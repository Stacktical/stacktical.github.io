## Calling all DSLA Champs! 🥊

The DSLA Residency Program is an initiative to encourage and reward contributions from our global community of DSLA Champs.

The DSLA Residency provides an avenue for valuable feedback to the core team and will also provide opportunities for Residents to give input on DSLA, acting as a DAO testbed and a critical component of our decentralization journey.

The core team will post Challenges on the [DSLA Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/dsla/) page under the [DSLA Residency Project](https://app.dework.xyz/dsla/main-project-1926) for interested community members to review and undertake. Completing one of these tasks will entitle DSLA Residents to a DSLA bounty! Bounties are identified in Dework for each Challenge.

In the future, holders of certain roles granted by holding DSLA Metaverse NFTs will have preferred access to claim Challenges and bounties before anyone else!

### Discord Integration 🤖

We will be leveraging Discord as our main chat tool for interacting with the community on the Residency and DAO operations due to it's flexibility and superior integrations with other tools such as Dework. Don't worry -- Telegram will still be an active and maintained community, but Discord will be the primary chat tool for DAO and Residency related topics.

We'll also be asking Residents for feedback on various DSLA related initiatives to help guide our efforts, and integrating other tools in our DAO stack, so please be sure to join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/2XhwdRjFnn)!

### What are we looking for? 👀

There are several categories where we would like to see Residency input:

📈 Marketing

👩‍💻 Development

🧪 Protocol Design

👨‍💻 DevSecOps

🪶 Technical Writing

⚙️ Developer Advocacy

### How Do You Get Involved? 🙋‍♂️

Check out the [Residency Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/dsla/main-project-1926) and review the open Challenges. Some Challenges may be managed via an Application process, some may be open to accept multiple submissions and reward the best contribution.

In the future, some Challenges will be only available for community members who hold certain Discord roles, which will be granted by holding certain DSLA Metaverse NFTs.

### Open to Residency Ideas! 💡

We've seeded the [Residency Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/dsla/main-project-1926) page with a few initial tasks and will be adding more in the near future and as needs arise.

If you have a great idea for something that can be done in one of the categories listed above, but it's not currently listed as an open issue in the [Residency Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/dsla/main-project-1926), please let us know! We have a dedicated channel in Discord for the DSLA Residency and there is also board for [Community Suggestions](https://app.dework.xyz/dsla/main-project-1926/community) on Dework. We are happy to consider other ideas for tasks that add value to DSLA or the DSLA family of products!

### **Developers**, This Includes You!

We think the DSLA Residency is a great opportunity for developers to contribute to DSLA at their own pace and be rewarded for their efforts. The [Residency Dework](https://app.dework.xyz/dsla/main-project-1926) has been seeded with a couple of Challenges targeted at developers!

If that interests you, check out the [DSLA Protocol Developer Toolkit (DTK)](https://github.com/Stacktical/stacktical-dsla-developer-toolkit) and the [DSLA Protocol Developer Guide](https://readme.stacktical.com/developer-guide/) to get started.

If you think there's a contribution you can make, let us know!

### DAO Transition

We're excited to get the journey underway for further decentralizing DSLA. Through 2022 we will be rolling out new tools in our DAO tool stack to further engage and empower the community in steering the future of DSLA.
