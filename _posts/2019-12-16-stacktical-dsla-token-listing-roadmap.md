## When new exchange ?

*ðŸŽ‰ Edit: We have officially left P2PB2B for [STEX](https://app.stex.com/en/trade/pair/ETH/DSLA/1).*  
*ðŸŽ‰ Edit: DSLA/USDT debuts trading on [ProBit](https://www.probit.com/app/exchange/DSLA-USDT).*  
*ðŸŽ‰ Edit: DSLA/USDT debuts trading on [Bilaxy](https://bilaxy.com/trade/DSLA_USDT).*  

As an early stage business-to-business initiative, with a legitimate use of blockchain and decentralized ledger technologies, the Stacktical Platform has definitely room for adoption. And we're well aware that we have a lot to learn to achieve our goals as a company.

6 months after our initial appearance on the P2PB2B cryptocurrency exchange, the trading activity of the DSLA token have yet to meet the expectations of our community stakeholders. While this first listing put our company on the cryptocurrency map, and was undoubtedly an important step in the right direction, DSLA needs to be more liquid to fulfill its mission as the utility token of the **[DSLA Protocol](https://stacktical.com)**, and empower reward, compensation and staking scenarios on the Platform.

Thankfully, and with the help of our community, we have been exploring several new listing opportunities with this liquidity objective in mind. The result of this effort is a series of regulatory-compliant DSLA listing milestones, that closely follow the development maturity of the collection of smart contracts empowering Stacktical.

| Phase        |Â Description           |Â ETA           | DSLA Protocol Network Maturity | Status           | Exchange 
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| 0 | Token Generation Event| Q3 2018 | **Genesis** of the DSLA Protocol | **Done** |Â **N/A**
| 1 | Initial Listing | Q3 2019 | **Alpha** available on the Ethereum **Test** Network | **Done** | P2PB2B
| 2 | Bridge 1 | Q1 2020 | **Beta** available on the Ethereum **Test** Network  | **Done** | [STEX](https://app.stex.com/en/trade/pair/ETH/DSLA/1)
| 3 | Bridge 2 | Q2 2020 | **Release Candidate** available on the Ethereum **Test** Network  | **Done** | [ProBit](https://www.probit.com/app/exchange/DSLA-USDT)
| 4 | Bridge 3 | Q3 2020 | **Release Candidate** available on the Ethereum **Test** Network  | **Done**  | [Bilaxy](https://bilaxy.com/trade/DSLA_USDT)
| 5 | Major Listing | 2021 | **Release** on the Ethereum **Main** Network | TBA | TBA

As you can see, in the short term, **we will partner with a new mid-tier exchange in Q1 2020**, as we'll be moving to the Beta phase of the DSLA Protocol and DSLA Network.
But our end goal is to list DSLA on a major exchange **when, and only when, the Stacktical Platform is ready to demonstrate its full potential**.   


| Network Maturity | Description           | DSLA Protocol Token Integration           |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| Genesis | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are not available yet. | No DSLA  
| Alpha | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are privately available on the testnet. | Test DSLA tokens  
| Beta | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are publicly available on the testnet. | Test DSLA tokens  
| Release Candidate | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are publicly available on the mainnet, in limited mode. | Real DSLA tokens  
| Release | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are publicly available on the mainnet, without limitation. | Real DSLA tokens   

At maximum Network Maturity, **real DSLA tokens are used by the protocol to empower production applications**.

While we originally planned for a major listing in December, there is simply too much blood in the streets, and too little fundamentals, to support this decision at this time. With an intermediary listing and increased liquidity, **DSLA will also have a greater chance to meet [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)'s listing requirements**, and dramatically expand the global reach of the Stacktical project.
