## When new exchange ?

As an early stage business-to-business initiative, with a legitimate use of blockchain and decentralized ledger technologies, the Stacktical Platform has definitely room for adoption. But we are also well aware that we have a lot to learn, to achieve our goals as a company.

6 months after our initial appearance **[on the P2PB2B cryptocurrency exchange](https://p2pb2b.io/trade/DSLA_ETH),** the trading activity of the DSLA token have yet to meet the expectations of our stakeholders. While this first listing put our company on the cryptocurrency map, and was undoubtedly an important step in the right direction, DSLA needs to be more liquid to fulfill its mission as a governance protocol.

Thankfully, we have been exploring several new listing opportunities with this objective in mind. The result of this effort is a series of DSLA listing milestones, that closely follow the development maturity of the collection of smart contracts empowering Stacktical.

| Phase        | Description           | ETA           | DSLA Protocol Network Maturity | Status           | Exchange 
| :------------- | :-------------| :-------------| :-------------| :-------------| :-------------|
| Phase 0 | DSLA issuance | Q3 2018 | **N/A** | **Done** | **N/A**
| Phase 1 | Initial Listing | Q3 2019 | *α* available on the Ethereum **Test** Network | **Done** | [P2PB2B](https://p2pb2b.io/trade/DSLA_ETH)
| Phase 2 | Bridge Listing 1 | Q1 2020 | *β* available on the Ethereum **Test** Network  | **In Progress** | TBA
| Phase 2' | Bridge Listing 2 | Q2/Q3 2020 | *RC* available on the Ethereum **Main** Network  | **In Progress** | TBA
| Phase 3 | Major Listing | TBA | Officially available on the Ethereum **Main** Network | **Agreement In** | TBA

Long story short, our end goal is to list DSLA on a major exchange **when, and only when, the Stacktical Platform and the DSLA Protocol are ready to demonstrate their full potential**. 


| Network Maturity | Description           | DSLA Protocol Token Integration           |
| :-------------| :-------------| :-------------|
| Genesis | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are not available yet. | No DSLA
| Alpha | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are privately available on the testnet. | Test DSLA tokens
| Beta | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are publicly available on the testnet. | Test DSLA tokens
| Release Candidate | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are publicly available on the mainnet, in limited mode. | Real DSLA tokens
| Release | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are publicly available on the mainnet, without limitation. | Real DSLA tokens 

In the meantime, **we will partner with a new, medium-sized exchange in Q1 2020** to increase our chances of being featured in top-tier discovery service such as **[CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)**, and provide a second, reliable purchasing option to our community.

We originally planned for a December listing but, as you might have notices, there's simply too much blood in the streets at this time.
