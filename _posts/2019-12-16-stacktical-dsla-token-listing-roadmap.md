## When new exchange ?

As an early stage business-to-business initiative with a legitimate use for blockchain technologies, the Stacktical Platform has definitely room for adoption and commercial growth. But it goes without saying that we also have a lot to learn, to achieve these goals, as a young company.

6 months after our initial listing **[on the P2PB2B exchange](https://p2pb2b.io/trade/DSLA_ETH),** the DSLA trading volume and activity have yet to meet the expectations of our community, and offer relatively poor onboarding conditions for our institutional partners. While it is worth noting that this first listing put our project on the cryptocurrency map, and was undoubtedly a step in the right direction, our team is well aware that it is high time for novelty.

Now, we want to actively work on bringing the liquidity we need to fully empower DSLA compensation scenarios on the main Ethereum network, and have a better shot at getting promoted on top tier discovery platforms such as **[CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/)**.

We have been exploring several new listing opportunities with this objective in mind.The result of this effort is a series of DSLA listing milestones that closely follow the development maturity of the DSLA Protocol, the collection of smart contracts empowering Stacktical:


| Phase        | Description           | ETA           | DSLA Protocol Network Maturity | Status           | Exchange 
| :------------- | :-------------| :-------------| :-------------| :-------------| :-------------|
| Phase 0 | DSLA issuance | Q3 2018 | **N/A** | **Done** | **N/A**
| Phase 1 | Initial Listing | Q3 2019 | *α* available on the Ethereum **Test** Network | **Done** | [P2PB2B](https://p2pb2b.io/trade/DSLA_ETH)
| Phase 2 | Bridge Listing 1 | Q1 2020 | *β* available on the Ethereum **Test** Network  | **In Progress** | TBA
| Phase 2 | Bridge Listing 2 | Q2/Q3 2020 | *RC* available on the Ethereum **Main** Network  | **In Progress** | TBA
| Phase 3 | Major Listing | TBA | Officially available on the Ethereum **Main** Network | **Agreement In** | TBA

Our end goal is to land on a major exchange when, and only when, the platform is ready to demonstrate its full potential.

| Network Maturity | Description           | DSLA Protocl Token Integration           |
| :-------------| :-------------| :-------------|
| N/A | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are not available yet. | No DSLA
| αlpha | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are privately available on the testnet. | Test DSLA tokens
| βeta | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are publicly available on the testnet. | Test DSLA tokens
| RC | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are publicly available on the mainnet, in limited mode. | Real DSLA tokens
| Live | DSLA Protocol smart contracts are publicly available on the mainnet, without limitation. | Real DSLA tokens 

For now, we will focus on listing DSLA in Q1 2020, on an exchange that is more representative of the current maturity of our the DSLA Protocol.
