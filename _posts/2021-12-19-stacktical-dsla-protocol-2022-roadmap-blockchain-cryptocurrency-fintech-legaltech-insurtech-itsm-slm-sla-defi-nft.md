## 🎯 New Year, New Goals

Dear members of the DSLA community, stakeholders of the future of the Internet, we are excited to announce that our official website at [stacktical.com](https://stacktical.com) has been updated with the 2022 roadmap of DSLA Protocol, and the DSLA family of products. 🎉

This roadmap does not mention our Q1 2022 exchange listing milestone, for regulatory compliance reasons.

## 🗓 Mark your Calendar

Parametric. Programmable. Peer-to-Peer. Crowdfunded.

The DSLA Protocol core team has been **pioneering a decentralized alternative to service level agreements since 2018**.

2022 will mark the consolidation of the value proposition of SLAs for the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and Metaverse Finance (MetaFi) sectors, as well as our first notable foray into real world, third-party risk management use cases.

The DSLA core team will introduce new parametric insurance primitives that enable developers, liquidity providers and customers to build, integrate, monetise and use risk swaps for a wider variety of third-party risks. 

In the meantime, DSLA Protocol will keep evolving until it reaches the v2 stage, ready to fulfill its original mission at scale. It is going to be an incredible year again.
