## Consolidating our growth

Dear DSLA champions, we are proud to announce that we have updated our DSLA token listing roadmap to integrate a 4th bridge listing!

This new listing will further allow DSLA to be eligible for proper ranking on [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dsla-protocol/), support the recent rocket growth of DSLA token holders, as well as provide a cheaper alternative to Uniswap and the unbearable gas fees our community has been experiencing for the past weeks.

## A new CEX enters the arena

## About DSLA Protocol
[![DSLA Network, Tezos SLA](/assets/img/2021-01-22-stacktical-dsla-protocol-itsm-sla-tezos-xtz-staking-baking-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-defi.jpg)](https://stacktical.com)

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables businesses to reduce their customers exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements and bonus-malus insurance policies.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).
