## The DSLA Metaverse and Genesis Mint 🗺️

The Genesis world of the DSLA Metaverse is made up six elemental-themed biomes. Each biome's elemental theme is associated with a different type of risk that DSLA Protocol can be used to manage.

As communicated [previously](https://blog.stacktical.com/dapp/academy/2021/10/07/stacktical-dsla-protocol-academy-genesis-mint-blockchain-cryptocurrency-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-itsm-slm-sla-defi-nft.html), a snapshot was taken of all wallets holding at least 100K DSLA tokens by November 30th, 2021 at 10pm CET. 101 lucky winners were randomly selected from the snapshot to receive one of the Genesis Mint NFTs.

### Introducing the Biomes 🌍

Each biome in the Genesis world has a primary element (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Light, Dark) and represents a type of risk that DSLA Protocol can be used to manage. The six biomes and use cases are: 

| Biome                 | Risk Type              |
|-----------------------|------------------------|
|🔥 Wildfire Fields&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; | APR/APY |
|💧 Uptime Falls | Uptime |
|🌍 Quicksand Dips | NFT Floor Price |
|🌪️ Volatility Creeks | Volatility Mitigation |
|☀️ Fiber Peaks | Response Time |
|🌑 Moongate Abyss | Withdrawal Time |

## Functional Art

Within the DSLA Metaverse there are three types of NFT's: 
* Lore
* Knowledge
* Skill

DSLA Metaverse NFT's are #functionalart, being not only collectible as high-quality art in their own right, but further enhanced with meaningful DSLA Protocol functionality.

### Lore NFT's 📜

Lore NFT's capture the history, backstory and other elements making up parts of the the DSLA Metaverse. The Genesis mint biome NFT's are Lore NFT's, with a limited capped supply of each Gen 0 biome. Lore NFT's have the following potential utilities:
* PFP / Art collectible
* Protocol modifiers
* Staking APR modifiers

The plan for the Gen. 0 biome NFT's is that they will be able to be staked to earn a portion of protocol returns for that biome.

### Knowledge NFT's 📖

These are NFT's that may be minted to represent knowledge gained learning in the the DSLA Academy. Knowledge NFT's may potentially have the following utilities:

* PFP / Art collectible
* Mint fee sharing
* Staking NFT's for other benefits and rewards

### Skill NFT's ⚔️

Skill NFT's can be minted after putting knowledge gained in the Academy to use and interacting with DSLA Protocol. These NFT's will have the most utility in the DSLA Metaverse, as they are meant to reward and incentivize Protocol use.

Because all interactions are on-chain, we can validate protocol usage and calcualte "experience points" based on use. Experience will be calculated and factor into Skill NFT minting in multiple ways. Users may need to meet certain usage thresholds for different skill NFT's to be available to mint. Experience may also factor in when minting with higher experience giving a better chance at more rare or powerful skill NFT's.

Skill NFT's will have numerous potential utilities including:

* PFP / Art collectible
* Mint fee sharing
* Protocol modifiers
* Staking APR modifiers
* Dev royalty modifiers
* DAO participation
* Content contribution rights

## Quicksand Dips and the Floor Price SLA 🛡️

So, maybe this is a good time to talk about the Quicksand Dips biome, and it's use case of 'NFT Floor Price Protection' (that's new!).

For 2022 we've got an impressive roadmap working towards scaling development, adoption and use of DSLA Protocol. The core team is also working on some big things that have not been announced or put on the roadmap 😉. NFT Floor Price protection, aka Pixel Mutual, is one of these initiatives.

Pixel Mutual will be a standalone dApp, giving projects the ability to guarantee floor price for their NFTs, increasing their project's profile and reach by providing confidence to early supporters and minters.

This use case is still being fine tuned, but once ready our Genesis Mint NFT's are going to be the first NFT's that put the Floor Price SLA to use.

Pixel Mutual Floor Price Protection, powered by DSLA Protocol, how's that for a surprise? 💣
