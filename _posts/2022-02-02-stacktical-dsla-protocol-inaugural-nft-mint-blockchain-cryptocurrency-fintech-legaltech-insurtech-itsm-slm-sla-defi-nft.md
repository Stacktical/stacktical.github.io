## The DSLA Metaverse and Genesis Mint 🗺️

The Genesis NFTs are out!

As communicated [previously](https://blog.stacktical.com/dapp/academy/2021/10/07/stacktical-dsla-protocol-academy-genesis-mint-blockchain-cryptocurrency-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-itsm-slm-sla-defi-nft.html), a snapshot was taken of all wallets holding at least 100K DSLA tokens as of November 30, 2021. **101** winners were randomly selected from the snapshot to receive a Genesis Mint NFT, and we're happy to announce that distribution is complete!

Feel free to check out the [collection on Opensea](https://opensea.io/collection/dsla-metaverse) and let's dive into the details below. 👇

### Introducing the Biomes 🌍

We wanted a way to represent DSLA Protocol being used to battle risk that made sense and was easy to connect with. What made sense to us for representing different types of risk?

Elements. Fire🔥, Water💧, Earth🌍, Air🌪️, Light☀️, Dark🌑.

And so the Genesis world in the DSLA Metaverse is made up of six different elemental-themed biomes, with each element representing a different type of risk that DSLA Protocol can be used to manage.

Each biome has an Outpost that is established in it to battle the risk and/or harvest resources. Users will be able to earn and mint NFTs, then put them to work in the biomes and Outposts. The NFTs, biomes and Outposts will add an element of gamification to encourage and reward use, while still keeping DSLA Protocol accessible and professional.

## NFTs with Utility

Within the DSLA Metaverse there are three types of NFTs: 
* Lore
* Knowledge
* Skill

DSLA Metaverse NFTs are not only collectible as high-quality art in their own right, but further enhanced with meaningful DSLA Protocol functionality.

The biome artwork for the Genesis Mint was created by [Abi Daker](https://twitter.com/abidaker). We encourage you to check out her other amazing works!

### Lore NFTs 📜

Lore NFTs capture the history, mythology and other elements making up the the DSLA Metaverse backstory. The Genesis mint biome NFTs are Lore NFTs, with a limited capped supply of each Gen 0 biome (noted on the NFT).

### Knowledge NFTs 📖

These are NFTs that may be minted to represent knowledge gained learning in the the DSLA Academy.

### Skill NFTs ⚔️

Skill NFTs can be minted after putting knowledge gained in the Academy to work by using DSLA Protocol. These NFTs will have the most utility in the DSLA Metaverse, as they are meant to reward and incentivize Protocol use.

Because all interactions are on-chain, we can validate protocol usage and calcualte "experience points" based on use. Experience will be calculated and factor into some Skill NFT minting. For instance, users may need to meet certain usage thresholds for different skill NFTs to be available to mint.

## Quicksand Dips and The Academy 🏰

Users in the DSLA Academy are known as Scholars, and they will use the Academy as the hub for embarking on their DSLA metaverse journey. At the Academy, Scholars can access educational content to help them learn about the blockchain, DSLA Protocol and hedging third party risk.

Developers, which we call Engineers in the Academy, can learn about building with and integrating DSLA Protocol risk management middleware.

Scholars and Engineers will be able to mint different NFTs to represent Knowledge they have acquired learning from the Academy and the Skills they have acquired and improved interacting with DSLA Protocol. The DSLA Bonfire is located in the Academy, which you can see on the Quicksand Dips Biome NFT, and is where users will burn DSLA tokens to mint NFTs.
