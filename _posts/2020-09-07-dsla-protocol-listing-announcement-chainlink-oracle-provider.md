## A new Oracle for your DSLA deployments

Dear DSLA Champions,

We are proud to announce that we have listed Chainlink as a new Oracle Network on DSLA.network

## DSLA is a Protocol of Protocols

In order to automate the enforcement of DSLA contracts, DSLA Protocol relies on specific components, at every step of a contract lifecycle.

### User Interface

DSLA.network is a web application hosted on Google Cloud Platform. 

It is responsible for the **drafting, deployment and management of DSLA contracts** on the DSLA protocol, as well as the **management of reward / compensation claims**.

### Protocol Hosting Infrastructure

DSLA contracts are deployed and hosted on the Ethereum blockchain network.

### Monitoring Target

A specific service to be monitored by DSLA Protocol. 

e.g. A proof-of-stake blockchain network like Harmony (ONE).

### Monitoring Service

A service responsible for monitoring the health of a service.

e.g. The staking analytics of a specific ONE validator.

### Indexation Network

A decentralized network of service responsible for indexing collected staking analytics. 

e.g. IPFS.

### Oracle Network

A decentralized network of services responsible for connecting indexed staking analytics to DSLA contracts.

### Settlement Service

DSLA contracts are enforced on the Ethereum blockchain network based on indexed staking analytics delivered by

## About the DSLA Incentivized Beta Test  

On September 30th 2020, DSLA core developers are organizing an incentivized beta to validate the functional, performance, reliability and security assumptions of the [DSLA.network ](https://dsla.network) decentralized application that integrates DSLA Protocol, before tentatively launching both products on the mainnet on November 30th 2020. Beta participants will be rewarded using beta bDSLA tokens that they will be converted to real, mainnet DSLA tokens upon launch.

To follow the news about the DSLA Incentivized Beta, feel free to subscribe to the project’s dedicated [Product Hunt page](https://www.producthunt.com/upcoming/dsla-network), and join the ongoing conversation [on Telegram](https://t.me/stacktical). 

The DSLA core development team will share more information about the beta roadmap very soon.
