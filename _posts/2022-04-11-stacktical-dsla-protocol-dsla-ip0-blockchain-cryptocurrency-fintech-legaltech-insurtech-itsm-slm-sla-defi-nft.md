## Embracing Governance üó≥Ô∏è

Dear members of the DSLA community, we are very excited to announce the next steps in DSLA Protocol's decentralization journey, with the introduction of governance. Going forward, we will start to manage some aspects of the evolution and growth of DSLA Protocol through governance.

[Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/) is the governance voting tool we will use and where DSLA-IP (DSLA Improvement Proposals) will live. Our DSLA Snapshot Space is live at [https://snapshot.org/#/dsla.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/dsla.eth), make sure you check it out and **join** so you will be able to **vote**!

### A Core Development Team √ó Community SLA ü§ù

Our genesis governance proposal is **DSLA-IP0** and it embodies the Core Team's commitment to deliver, disappointment with current delays and belief that Service Level Agreements are an excellent tool to incentivize good performance.

**DSLA-IP0** will establish a Service Level Agreement between the *DSLA core development team* and the *DSLA community* where the DSLA core development team will commit to meet official deliverables through 12/31/2022. This commitment will be backed by **14.73m** DSLA tokens, which will be used to compensate token holders if DSLA-based products are not delivered on time, as per the official roadmap at [stacktical.com](https://stacktical.com) and verified social calendar events at [CoinMarketCal](https://coinmarketcal.com/en/coin/dsla-protocol).

To be eligible for compensations, DSLA community token holders will need to **join** our DSLA Snapshot Space and **vote** on **DSLA-IP0**.

Check out **DSLA-IP0** [here](https://snapshot.org/#/dsla.eth/proposal/XXXXX) for full details and to **vote** on it!

### Future Protocol Governance

This is the first step in our governance journey, with the final destination being a fully decentralized DSLA Protocol, guided by the community. We're excited to start using DSLA-IP proposals through [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dsla.eth/) to guide the evolution of DSLA Protocol.

In the future user governance rights and content contribution rights will be based on holding Skill and Knowledge NFTs earned through the DSLA Metaverse and DSLA Academy. The vision is for the Metaverse to reward engagement and knowledge, and then have DSLA Protocol guided by those same engaged and knowledgeable community members.

Join our [Snapshot Space](https://snapshot.org/#/dsla.eth), vote and let's start guiding the future of DSLA Protocol together!
