## Enter the Metaverse 🔮

The DSLA Astromancer is a collection of 10,000 Astromancer PFP NFTs which act as your key to the DSLA Metaverse, unlocking the future of DSLA Protocol. 

Astromancer NFTs will grant access to summoning and staking in the DSLA Metaverse in addition to providing different utilities and benefits based on their attributes. Astromancer NFTs will also be the key participate in governance voting and submitting governance proposals.

Unlike many NFT projects, this is not a PFP with just a roadmap. The Astromancer NFT is a PFP that expands upon a fully functional and developed protocol, with several novel use cases releasing imminently. The Astromancer will be the key to future governance rights and staking for Biome reward distributions.

## Attributes

Let's look at the various attributes an Astromancer can have and how those attributes affect its utility.

[![Anatomy of an Astromancer](/assets/img/2022-10-25-anatomy-of-an-astromancer.png)](/assets/img/2022-10-25-anatomy-of-an-astromancer)

### Biomes

Staking a Biome will entitle the staker to reward distributions from that Biome. As we covered in the [Metaverse Prologue blog post](https://blog.stacktical.com/metaverse/nft/2022/03/01/stacktical-dsla-protocol-metaverse-inaugural-nft-mint-blockchain-cryptocurrency-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-itsm-slm-sla-defi-nft.html), each Biome represents a specific type of risk that DSLA can help hedge against.

Users will only be able to stake a Biome if they have an Astromancer with that biome in its orbit. For instance, the Astromancer above in the ***Anatomy of an Astromancer*** infographic could stake the Fire (Wildfire Fields), Water (Uptime Falls), Light (Fibre Peaks), Dark (Moongate Abyss) and Air (Volatility Creeks) biomes. With that Astromancer you would ***not*** be able to stake the Earth (Quicksand Dips) biome and receive staking reward distributions from it.

Earn biomes by being in the top 10 of the monthly leaderboard, by winning specific challenges or by completing specific tasks like summoning a Familiar III.

### Strong and Weak Element

Astromancers are an elemental being with a strong element and a weak element.

Enjoy a modifier that increases Biome staking returns for the Biome associated with your Astromancer's strong element.

On the flip side, Biome staking returns will be reduced for the Biome matching the element where your Astromancer is weak.

### Familiars

Familiars help your Astromancer battle risk through the DSLA Metaverse. Each familiar is suited to its home Biome's elemental enviroment and adept at battling the risk Adversary they will encounter there.

Familiars entitle holders to multipliers on Biome staking rewards and governance voting.

Complete skill-proving tasks like creating SLAs or providing liquidity to earn Skill NFTs, then burn Skill NFTs at the Crucible to summon or upgrade Familiars.

### Moon Phases

Astromancers can have up to six Moon Phases, which will be used to provide Parametric Staking bonuses in the DSLA Metaverse during the corresponding real-world matching moon phases.

## Σ, The Sum of All Elements

The Σ Astromancer is very rare and powerful, comprising less than 2% of the collection. Σ Astromancers are strong in all elements, weak in none, so receive a Strong Element modifier bonus for all staked Biomes and no Weak Element penalty.

Σ Astromancers have all Biomes in their orbit, meaning with them you can stake all Biomes to earn staking distributions.

## Minting

The target for minting to be available for the Astromancer is the first week of November. Enroll in The Academy at [dsla.network/academy](https://dsla.network/academy) to mint your Astromancer and secure your piece of DSLA's future.

Mint Fee: 0.101 Ξ

We would be remiss to not note that the DSLA Astromancer will also be the first NFT ever to be covered by DSLA's new NFT Floor Price Protection SLA.

## Fees and the DSLA Economy

A portion of Astromancer minting fees will go to buying back DSLA to deposit into the Parametric Staking Pool on [dsla.network/stake](https://dsla.network/stake).

In a similar fashion, a portion of fees generated in each Biome's use cases will be piped back to Biome NFT stakers, as noted above!
