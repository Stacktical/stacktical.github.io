## About the DSLA Protocol

![DSLA Protocol](https://storage.googleapis.com/stacktical-public/dsla-protocol_by_stacktical.png) 

**DSLA Protocol is a decentralized alternative to SLA contracts.**

DSLA Protocol and the DSLA.network √êapp, will debut an incentivized beta in Q4 2020, focusing on providing a hedge against staking risks, and unfulfilled reliability promises.
