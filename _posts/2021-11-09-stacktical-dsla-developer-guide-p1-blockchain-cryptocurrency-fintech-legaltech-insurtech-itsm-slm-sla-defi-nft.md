## ðŸ¥³ Introducing the DSLA Protocol Developer Toolkit (DTK) and Developer Guide

The DSLA Protocol core team is proud to announce the release of the [DSLA Protocol Developer Toolkit (DTK)](https://github.com/Stacktical/stacktical-dsla-developer-toolkit) and the [DSLA Protocol Developer Guide](https://readme.stacktical.com/developer-guide/). The DTK empowers developers to BUIDL new use cases and risk aware applications using DSLA Protocol, and the Developer Guide is there to help you get started!

### Value Proposition for BUIDLers

So why BUIDL with DSLA Protocol?

First, developers are able to leverage DSLA Protocol to build risk management directly into their dApps. Risk management capabilities can increase user confidence, attracting more users and leading to higher adoption.

Second, because of DSLA Protocol's reward/compensation mechanism, rewards are earned when service targets are met. Thus, adding risk management by integrating DSLA Protocol can actually provide an additional revenue stream for services that perform well.

On top of that, DSLA is an open protocol and incentivization is built into its core. Developers who create new use cases get a share of verification fees that are generated by that use case -- *forever*.

Verification fee distribution is as follows:
   * **25% to the developer who created the SLA logic**
   * 25% to the user doing the verification
   * 25% to DSLA Core team
   * 25% burned in DSLA's [bonfire burn events](https://blog.stacktical.com/bonfire/reporting/2021/10/23/stacktical-dsla-protocol-bonfire-burn-event-2-blockchain-cryptocurrency-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-itsm-slm-sla-defi-nft.html)

> Every time someone requests a verification of a SLA, the creator of the Messenger contract receives a reward from the SLA contract creator (part of the verification fee), managed by the DSLA protocol in a decentralized fashion. 

### What is a Use Case ðŸ¤”

A use case is a real world situation where DSLA Protocol can be integrated to provide risk management capabilities. On the technical side, in DSLA Protocol a use case is the package of contracts, logic and interactions that defines what real world data you are measuring and providing rewards or compensation based on.

Every use case can be broken down into four primary components:
* Messenger contract: It relays the messages between Chainlink and the SLA contract. A messenger defines how to query for data to the off chain Chainlink environment.
* Oracle contract: This contract defines the addresses that are allowed to fulfill requests. These addresses are controlled by the Chainlink node.
* Chainlink node: Is a service that awaits for onchain events to trigger the calculations. In this case, a Chainlink bridge is used to call the External adapter.
* External adapter: A Chainlink external adapter is a REST API service that can be called by a Chainlink node, which makes it extensible. It can be a simple Express.js app or a Flask app running as a micro service. This service is in charge of calculating the SLI, by gathering the necessary data and returning it back to the SLA contract.

>We are currently using Chainlink architecture to run our off-chain processes, but this doesn't mean that you can't use any other architecture. Messenger contract can be anything that returns a value for the SLA contract. What we describe in this documentation is the approach that we have developed so far. 

### Example Use Cases

Below are the main DeFi related use cases that the DSLA Protocol core  team are currently focused on, with APR/APY SLAs and Uptime SLAs already active on the flagship [DSLA.network](https://dsla.network) dApp.

| USE CASE | DESCRIPTION |
| -------------- | ---------------|
| APR/APY SLA | Hedge against diminishing staking returns and yields |
| Uptime SLA | Hedge against application, network and service downtimes |
| Response Time SLA | Hedge against slow application, network and service |
| Withdrawal Time SLA | Hedge against third party custodian lock-up |
| Impermanent Loss SLA | Hedge against negative market making returns |
| Peg SLA | Hedge against stablecoin and synthetic assets losing their peg |

However, use cases that DSLA Protocol can support are nearly endless. Keep your eyes peeled for future blog posts discussing use cases in other industries.
