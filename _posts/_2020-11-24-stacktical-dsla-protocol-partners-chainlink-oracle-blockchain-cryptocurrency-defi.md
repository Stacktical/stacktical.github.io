## DSLA x LINK

Dear community, [Stacktical](https://stacktical.com), the core development team of the DSLA Protocol, is proud to announce that we have partnered with [Chainlink](https://chain.link/) to bring decentralized price feeds and staking analytics to DSLA Protocol and its flagship Ðapp, [DSLA.network](https://dsla.network).

Chainlink is the industry-leading decentralized oracle network, providing reliable, tamper-proof inputs and outputs for smart contracts on the Ethereum, Polkadot and more blockchain networks.

### A Commitment to Resilient Infrastructures

While there are increasingly more solutions available on the market, in our testing, our engineers Chainlink integration proved to be a superior **fit for building DSLA Protocol without infrastructure point of failures**.  

Infrastructure Resilience is a major design requirement for the DSLA Protocol mainnet, and one of the key reasons why we are building DSLA on blockchain networks, instead of resorting to centralized infrastructures like our competitors do.

In order to fulfill our mission as a Service Governance vehicle and the future gatekeeper of Quality of Service (QoS), it is fundamental to design a risk management protocol that is not prone to the reliability risks that it mitigates.

### How we use the Chainlink Oracle Network

DSLA Protocol relies on the Chainlink decentralized oracle network to perform 3 types of operations:  

* **①** Display accurate, realtime price information in DSLA contracts
* **②** Convert ONE, ATOM and DOT stakes and delegations into their DSLA and DAI equivalent
* **③** Connect DSLA contracts with our IPFS and Polkadot indexers during a DSLA contract verification

We are looking forward to further collaborating with the Chainlink team on achieving our 2021 goals using their battle-tested network and technology.

## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Network, the flagship application of DSLA Protocol, a risk management protocol for developers](/assets/img/dsla-network_square-hand-shot-social.png)](https://dsla.network)

DSLA is a risk management protocol for developers, to build applications and operate infrastructures that are natively capable of financially protecting users against failures. 

It enables anyone to vouch for the reliability of a service, get paid when the service performs as expected, or get compensated when the service does not meet expectations.
