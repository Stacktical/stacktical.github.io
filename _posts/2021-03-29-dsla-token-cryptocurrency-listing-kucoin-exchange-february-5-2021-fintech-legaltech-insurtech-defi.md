## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Protocol](/assets/img/dsla-network_device-duo-stacked.jpg)](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xd0fbb87e47da9987d345dbdf3a34d4266cf5ebe9)

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables developers and infrastructure operators to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).
