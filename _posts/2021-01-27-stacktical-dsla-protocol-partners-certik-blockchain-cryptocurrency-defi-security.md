## DSLA Agreements x CertiKShield

DSLA Protocol enables anyone to add a service level agreement on top of any third-party service, to reduce customers’ exposure to infrastructure risks and incentivise the connectivity, performance and availability of services, networks and applications over time.

Stacktical, the core development team of DSLA Protocol is proud to announce that we are joining forces with leading security service provider CertiK Foundation, to secure the upcoming launch of the DSLA Protocol and DSLA.network flagship application, and work together on a series of product initiatives throughout the year and beyond.

“As our team and community are gearing up for the most important milestone in our company’s history, it is our utmost responsibility to ensure that our developments meet the highest possible security standards, and undergo the scrutiny of security service providers with a proven track record in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry. We are excited to collaborate with a leader like CertiK, that shares both our Risk Management and DevOps DNA through and through.” said Wilhem Pujar, CEO at Stacktical and DSLA Protocol core developer.

CertiK Business Development Manager, Marco Calicchia, mentions:
“CertiK is on a mission to assist the broader DeFi space in properly applying decentralized security principles. We understand the temptation for developers to describe their project as “experimental” and hope for the best. However, a single setback may hurt the entire space. Stacktical has demonstrated that security is a priority and we’re both committed towards a successful mainnet launch.”

## About DSLA Protocol
[![DSLA Network, Tezos SLA](/assets/img/2021-01-22-stacktical-dsla-protocol-itsm-sla-tezos-xtz-staking-baking-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-defi.jpg)](https://stacktical.com)

As users outsource increasingly more functions of their lives and businesses to third-party service providers, they need better ways to manage their exposure to third-party infrastructure risk. Especially when money is at stake.

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that gives anyone the ability to create, monitor and execute decentralized service level agreements and parametric insurance policies.

When the monitored performance of a service is within the thresholds of an agreement, third-party service providers and liquidity providers earn the right to claim a reward from the agreement liquidity pool. Conversely, when an agreement is violated, customers earn the right to claim a compensation. 

Win-Win.
