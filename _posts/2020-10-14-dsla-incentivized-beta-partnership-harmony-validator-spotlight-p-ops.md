## Meet P-OPS ~ Pangaea Operations

Dear DSLA Champions, we are proud to announce that P-OPS will participate in the DSLA Incentivized Beta Test, as a Harmony (ONE) Validator !

‚úçÔ∏è P-OPS will roll out a ONE Staking Efficiency DSLA contract, and stake at least 1M bDSLA tokens to the contract pool.

‚òîÔ∏è Active Delegators will be able to cover up to 100% of P-OPS Staking Efficiency drops.

## Get Involved, Earn Rewards!

The purpose of the DSLA incentivized beta is to validate the functional, performance, reliability and security assumptions of DSLA Protocol and DSLA.network, its flagship √êapp.

There are many ways to get involved, and earn rewards during the beta.

### As a Delegator

First and foremost, beta participants must **[fill in the Beta Phase 0 Application Form](http://bit.ly/dsla-beta)**. 

Make sure you share your ETH and ONE wallet addresses, as these will be used to allocate your DSLA rewards, after the DSLA Protocol mainnet launches later this year.

After that, it‚Äôs a 3 step process:

‚òùÔ∏è Stake your ONE tokens with P-OPS;

‚úåÔ∏è Be an Active Delegator during the DSLA beta;

ü§ü Hedge risks by staking bDSLA tokens to a ONE Staking Efficiency DSLA Contract.


As a Delegator, an active DSLA Contract entitles you to a bDSLA token compensation if P-OPS doesn‚Äôt meet your pre-agreed Staking Efficiency thresholds.

### As a Voucher
‚úö Create a DSLA contract to protect the deposits of P-OPS‚Äôs Active Delegators.

As a Voucher, an active DSLA Contract entitles you to a bDSLA token reward if P-OPS meets or exceeds the defined Staking Efficiency thresholds.
