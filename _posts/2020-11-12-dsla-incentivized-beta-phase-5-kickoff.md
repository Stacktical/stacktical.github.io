## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Token, now on Argent wallet](/assets/img/2020-08-26-dsla-token-available-on-Argent-keyless-wallet-screenshot.jpg)](https://stacktical.com)

[DSLA Protocol](https://stacktical.com) is a risk management framework that enables infrastructure operators and developers to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

DSLA Protocol's flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of Proof-of-Stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the connectivity, performance and availability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers.
