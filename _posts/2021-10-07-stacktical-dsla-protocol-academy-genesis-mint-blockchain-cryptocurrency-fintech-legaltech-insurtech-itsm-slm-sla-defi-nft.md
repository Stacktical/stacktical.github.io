## Back to NFT school

Dear community, in his latest video update, Wilhem shared [his vision for the DSLA Academy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7zHJCAhlWA), an interactive experience DSLA learning experience, powered by NFTs.

He highlighted a paradigm shift in education, switching from being passive learners to active owners of the knowledge we accumulate. 

He added that, as branding was becoming increasingly more akin to role play, the future of DSLA as a brand lies in its ability to share its lore, its mythology, with the community.

The tokenization of knowledge is a massive opportunity to explore a new utility for NFTs, and properly onboard you to the DSLA family of products. This is just the beginning.

Our ambition is to convey the full potential of DSLA as a risk derivatives protocol, and empower you to maximize the benefits you get from its technolgy, through your entire journey.

## Genisis Draft #0 Minting Event

To celebrate the upcoming launch of the DSLA Academy, we are proud to announce that 101 Genesis NFTs will be minted and randomly distributed to cryptocurrency users holding at least 100K DSLA by November 30th 10pm CET.

## About DSLA Protocol

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables developers and infrastructure operators to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).
