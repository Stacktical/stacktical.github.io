## End of the grace period: What's next

Dear community, as we're getting closer to the end of the mainnet grace period this week, DSLA Protocol and its flagship dapp will now begin to support more currencies, more staking service providers, and more blockchain networks. 

Here are some of the key dates you don't want to miss.

### April 22: Avalanche Integration

DSLA Protocol will add support for **AVAX Staking APR SLAs** on April 22, 2021. 

After introducing support for ONE Staking APR SLAs on April 14, Avalanche will be the next available network in the DSLA contract creation assistant of our flagship dapp.

### May 12: Polkadot Integration

DSLA Protocol will add support for **Polkadot (DOT) Staking APR SLAs**.

We have a lot more to share about the role of DSLA Protocol in the Polkadot ecosystem. But for starters, the popular network will be added to DSLA.network dapp along with a comprehensive list of DOT validators.

### June 2: Cosmos Integration

DSLA Protocol will add support for **Cosmos (ATOM) Staking APR SLAs**.

Some of the largest validators on the market has expressed the need for SLAs to facilitate the onboarding of their instutitional customers.

## 10-days Grace Period

Initiated with the launch of the DSLA.network dapp on April 14, the Grace Period is a *safe mode* designed to secure the roll out and fine tune the DSLA experience before our full-blown launch.

| Available currencies | DSLA, DAI, USDC | DSLA
| Network integrations | ONE, AVAX, DOT, ATOM, XTZ, eGLD, ROSE | ONE

## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Protocol](/assets/img/dsla-network_device-duo-stacked.jpg)](https://info.uniswap.org/pair/0xd0fbb87e47da9987d345dbdf3a34d4266cf5ebe9)

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables developers and infrastructure operators to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers such as Uniswap (AMM) and OpenSea (NFT).
