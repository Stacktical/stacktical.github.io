## The DSLA Metaverse Vision 🗺️

The vision behind the DSLA Metaverse is to build a tool that accomplishes several key tasks:
* Onboard new users
* Teach people about DSLA and how to use it to mitigate third-party risk
* Provide an interesting experience with light gamification to encourage and reward user engagement
* Empower active users who've shown themselves to be knowledgeable and engaged with proof-of-competency credentials
* Leverage this proof-of-competency to support decentralization of DSLA Protocol
* Augment traditional **token-balance-limited** governance with novel flexibility and functionality, powered by DSLA Metaverse NFTs

NFTs give us a powerful credentials technology, which can easily be leveraged in web3 with on-chain interactions to certify knowledge, competency and engagement. The DSLA Metaverse is an engine that delivers this overall experience for users.

The DSLA Metaverse is not meant to be a first-person immersive world, powered by Unreal Engine. Rather, our aim for the Metaverse is to build a system that rewards our most active and engaged users and creates a credentialed community in a decentralized manner, simply based on on-chain interactions.

While an Unreal Engine-like experience is not what our aim, we did want an interesting lore and taxonomy to keep people engaged, which is reflected in the fantastic artwork by [@abidaker](https://abidaker.com)!

## Under the Hood, a Platform Agnostic Engagement Framework 🏆

The platform we envisioned the DSLA Metaverse becoming required a new underlying framework to power it, which evolved into the tool we now have. The DSLA Metaverse is the **proof of concept**, but back-end powering the DSLA Metaverse experience is a platform agnostic engagement framework. Other projects and protocols can leverage the DSLA Metaverse framework to create their NFT-powered experience for decentralized engagement, rewards and credentialing based on specific, verified actions.

There are various benefits that can quite easily be given to holders based on them possessing a certain NFT(s), and other protocols would have to decide what is right for them. For the DSLA Metaverse, we have three main types of utility associated with Metaverse NFTs. 

## Reward Engaged Stakeholders - Protocol Bonuses 💰

Often what interests people the most! Earn bonuses by way of revenue sharing or fee discounts. For the DSLA Metaverse we have some NFTs that entitle holders to a share of mint fees, some that entitle holders to a share of biome (use case) protocol fees, and some that are modifiers on earnings.

## Learn from Engaged Stakeholders - Content Contribution Rights 🎓

In a decentralized world it makes sense to learn from others who can show that they have a good understanding of a topic. Now this has to come with the ubiquitous web3 warning to verify and always be on the lookout for scams. Also on having an approval process for content additions, much like you would for pull requests, so a review is done and any potentially harmful content is caught.

## Empower Engaged Stakeholders - Governance by More than Tokens 🗳️

Most token-based governance programs have a limitation and weakness in just using token count for governance direction. In some instances this can put all governance power in the hands of people who aren't even using the protocol.

Is this the be-all or end-all? No. However, we definitely think it can be part of the toolbox to make governance more effective and egalitarian.

## What Else?

We're excited to get the DSLA Metaverse off the ground and would like to hear thoughts from our community and other potential adoptoooors.

Should we look at making some of the DSLA Metaverse NFTs Soul-bound NFTs? There are arguments for and against and we'd love to hear peoples perspective.

Should some of the DSLA Metaverse NFTs have a timed aspect to their functionality or utility?

How else can we maximize the benefits of this platform? Let's talk about it in our Discord or on our Commonwealth page!
