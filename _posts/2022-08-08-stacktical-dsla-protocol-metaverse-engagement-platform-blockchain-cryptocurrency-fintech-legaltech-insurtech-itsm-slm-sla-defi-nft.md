## The DSLA Metaverse Vision 🗺️

The vision behind the DSLA Metaverse is to build a tool that accomplishes several key tasks:
* Onboard new users
* Teach people about DSLA, and how to use it to mitigate third-party risk
* Provide an interesting experience with light gamification to encourage and reward user engagement
* Empower active users who've shown themselves to be knowledgeable and engaged with proof-of-competency credentials
* Leverage this proof-of-competency to support decentralization of DSLA Protocol
* Augment traditional **token-balance-limited** governance with novel flexibility and functionality, powered by DSLA Metaverse NFTs

NFTs give us a powerful credentials technology, which can easily be leveraged in web3 with on-chain interactions to certify knowledge, competency and engagement. The DSLA Metaverse is an engine that delivers this overall experience for users, with Metaverse NFTs then providing the keys to unlock different utilities and benefits.

The DSLA Metaverse is not meant to be a first-person immersive world, powered by Unreal Engine. Rather, our aim for the Metaverse is to build a system that rewards our most active and engaged users and creates a credentialed community in a decentralized manner, simply based on protocol usage.

While an Unreal Engine-like experience is not what our aim, we did want an interesting lore and taxonomy to keep people engaged, which is reflected in the fantastic artwork by [@abidaker](https://abidaker.com)!

## Under the Hood, a Platform Agnostic Engagement Framework 🏆

The experience we envisioned for the DSLA Metaverse required a new underlying framework to power it, which evolved into the tool we now have. Think of this framework a little like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com), but for NFTs. **IFTTM** -- If This Then **Mint**.

The DSLA Metaverse is a **proof of concept**, the first engagement experience built on top of this new IFTTM engagement framework.

Other projects and protocols will be able to leverage this IFTTM framework to create their own NFT-powered experience for decentralized engagement, rewards and credentialing based on specific, verified actions.

The options are nearly limitless for what benefits and utility may be assigned to NFTs earned through the engagement framework, and they will vary from project to project. For the DSLA Metaverse, we have three main types of utility associated with earned Metaverse NFTs. 

## Reward Engaged Stakeholders - Protocol Bonuses 💰

Often what interests people the most!

Earn bonuses by way of revenue sharing or fee discounts. For the DSLA Metaverse we have some NFTs that entitle holders to a share of mint fees, some that entitle holders to a share of biome (use case) protocol fees, and some that are modifiers on earnings.

## Learn from Engaged Stakeholders - Content Contribution Rights 🎓

DSLA Metaverse NFTs are a manifestation of a user's knowledge of and experience with DSLA Protocol. In decentralized communities it makes sense to learn from others who have knowledge of a certain topic, especially if that knowledge is verefiable.

Some DSLA Metaverse NFTs will entitle holders to contribute content to the Metaverse or Academy courses, advancing decentralization and creating a culture of knowledge sharing.
## Empower Engaged Stakeholders - Governance by More than Tokens 🗳️

Most token-based governance programs have a limitation and weakness in just using token count for governance direction. In some instances this can put the interests of users and whale token holders at odds or a situation where all governance power is in the hands of those who aren't even using a protocol.

We can leverage DSLA's Metaverse NFTs to give governance power to users based on actual protocol usage and engagement. Funcitonality could include:
* Ablility to submit Requests For Comments (RFC) on [Commonwealth](https://commonwealth.im/dsla)
* Ability to submit new Proposals for voting on [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/dsla.eth)
* Voting modifier or gating certain votes to NFT holders

Is this the ultimate solution to the governance conundrum? Maybe not, but we definitely think it can be part of the toolbox to make governance more effective and egalitarian.

## What Else? 🤔

We're excited to get the DSLA Metaverse off the ground and would like to hear thoughts from our community and other potential **IFTTM framework** adoptoooors.

Should we look at making some of the DSLA Metaverse NFTs Soul-bound NFTs? There are arguments for and against that, and we'd love to hear your perspective.

Should some of the DSLA Metaverse NFTs have a timed aspect to their functionality or utility?

How else can we maximize the benefits of this platform?
