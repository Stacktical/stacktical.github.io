## The DSLA Metaverse Vision 🗺️

The vision behind the DSLA Metaverse is to build a tool that accomplishes several key tasks:
* Onboard new users
* Teach people about DSLA and how to use it
* Provide an interesting experience with light gamification to encourage and reward user engagement
* Empower active users who've shown themselves to be knowledgeable and engaged
* Leverage this proof-of-competency to support decentralization of DSLA Protocol
* Augment traditional strictly **token-balance-based** governance with novel flexibility and functionality, powered by DSLA Metaverse NFTs

NFTs give us a powerful credentials technology, which can easily be leveraged in web3 with on-chain interactions to certify knowledge, competency and engagement.
