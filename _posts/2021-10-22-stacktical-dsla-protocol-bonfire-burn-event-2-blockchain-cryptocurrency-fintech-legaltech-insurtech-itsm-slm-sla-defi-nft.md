## Edition #2 was a success

Dear community, we're continuing to stoke the fires, as DSLA Protocol lays the groundwork for scaling!  Bonfire Burn Event #2 was focused on protocol-driven token burns, and we're pleased to announce that we have successfully proceeded with the burn of **XXXXXXXXXXXX DSLA tokens** during Bonfire Burn Event #2.üî•

As noted in the [recap of our inaugaral Bonfire Burn Event](http://localhost:4000/bonfire/reporting/2021/08/27/stacktical-dsla-protocol-bonfire-burn-event-1-blockchain-cryptocurrency-fintech-legaltech-insurtech-itsm-slm-sla-defi-nft.html), future Bonfire Burn Events are focused on protocol-driven token burns and proper usage analytics. This is exciting because it means that unlike Bonfire Burn Event #1, where a significant portion of the tokens burned were one-time holding burns, Bonfire Burn Event #2 provides a real jumping off point for ongoing (repeatable!) token burns from protocol use.

With the recent roll out of stablecoin and native currency support by the DSLA Protocol core team, the stage is set for DSLA to scale to the next level.  As a result we should be communicating some developments very soon that will result in increased protocol usage **and increased fuel for the coming quarterly Bonfire Burn Events.** 

The future is bright -- bright like a Bonfire!üî•

## Impact

### Supply Adjustment

DSLA Bonfire Burn Event #2 results in a **reduction of the DSLA total supply to XXXXXXXXXX.00 DSLA**. 

Other metrics, that directly depend on the total supply, are impacted accordingly:

* The circulating supply **decreases to XXXXXXXXXX DSLA (92.5% of total supply)**
* The DSLA market cap **decreases from XXM USD to XXM USD**

## Future

**üî• DSLA Bonfire Burn Event #3**  
**üóì Friday, January 21, 2022**

### New Partnerships

**Expect some news this quarter**

We're excited about some new partners that are ready to take advantage of stablecoin and native token support!

### Bonfire Application

During the incenvitized beta test of the DSLA Protocol, the "Bonfire" designated the social space of the [DSLA.Network](https://dsla.network/) flagship application. It's a feature we imagine could bring our community members together around the key metrics of the DSLA family of products.

Our core team is working on bringing a Bonfire √êapp to life to achieve this very goal! More information about this new initiative soon!

## About DSLA Protocol

[![DSLA Protocol](/assets/img/dsla-protocol_ecosystem.jpg)](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/dsla-protocol#markets**)

DSLA Protocol is a risk management framework that enables developers and infrastructure operators to reduce their users exposure to service delays, interruptions and financial losses, using self-executing service level agreements, bonus-malus insurance policies, and crowdfunded liquidity pools.

Its flagship use case is to offset the financial losses of proof-of-stake delegators and DeFi users, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators and DeFi service providers.
