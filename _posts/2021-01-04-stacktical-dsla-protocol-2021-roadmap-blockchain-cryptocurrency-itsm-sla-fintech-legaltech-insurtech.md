## Happy New Year 2021

On behalf of the DSLA core development team, I would like to wish our dear community a successful, happy new year 2021! May your aspirations come true, and let us all make a conscious effort to approach the days, weeks and months ahead with renewed resilience and confidence. 

While the rest of the world seems to be on the verge of collapsing, the cryptocurrency industry is glimmering with optimism. Proof-of-Stake is [taking over Layer 1](https://www.stakingrewards.com/) blockchain networks, Layer 2 blockchain sub-networks start [addressing barriers to enterprise adoption](https://entethalliance.org/how-ethereum-layer-2-scaling-solutions-address-barriers-to-enterprises-building-on-mainnet/), and there is a rapidly growing number of [decentralized applications](https://1inch.exchange/#/ETH/DSLA) and protocols that our global community can tap into for education, for inspiration, for utility.

Our team now also possesses all the components it needs to share our full vision for DSLA Protocol, and articulate a more cohesive product offering than ever before.

## DSLA Protocol

DSLA is a protocol for developers, designed to streamline the integration of site reliability engineering and parametric insurance to the next wave of connected and online customer experiences. 

Once DSLA Protocol's smart contracts and official documentation will be available, any developer will be able to tap into the protocol's functions to implement the use case of their choice, and augment the user experience of their existing products.

As developers ourselves, we use DSLA Protocol to build [DSLA.network](http://dsla.network/), our flagship √êapp. It provides a financial hedge against staking infrastructure risks for Proof-of-Stake delegators, while incentivizing the good performance and reliability of staking pool operators.

Think of it as a way to lead developers by example, with a laser-focused use case with high commercial viability.

To ensure that DSLA.network meets its market, we ran hundreds of user interviews with wallet developers, staking pool operators and Proof-of-Stake network teams, and addressed their functional and non-functional requirements with care.

Except for one requirement: the ability to **use DSLA Protocol on other blockchain networks than Ethereum**.

## Agnos & Maxima

To address the need expressed by an ever growing number of potential customers and friends, we are officializing DSLA Maxima, a native, stand-alone edition of DSLA Protocol on your favorite network.

Our network-agnostic product, the original DSLA Protocol running on the Ethereum blockchain, will be identified as DSLA Agnos, moving forwards.

With Maxima, the DSLA core developers are joining forces with the best Proof-of-Stake network teams to enable our community of developers to :  

- Tap into their network-specific capabilities (e.g. Elrond's high throughput);
- Access available DeFi protocols using composability;
- Use their favorite cryptocurrency or cryptocurrency standard;

Furthermore, Maxima will empower the development of new industry use cases that are either not possible on Ethereum today, or a poor fit for a variety of reasons.

## High Level 2021 Roadmap

Our overall plan for the year is to:

‚òùÔ∏è Wrap up the scope of our **W3F grant** bringing value to the Polkadot ecosystem;

‚úåÔ∏è Ship the **DSLA Protocol Agnos mainnet** release to Ethereum;

ü§ü Trigger and ship a new **DSLA Protocol Maxima initiative** every quarter.
